A black box in your car ?
As America &apos;s road pl@@ ann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to m@@ end a cr@@ um@@ bling high@@ way system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that f@@ its ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every m@@ ile a mot@@ or@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureau@@ cr@@ ats , are at the center of a contro@@ versi@@ al attempt in Washington and state planning offices to over@@ ha@@ ul the out@@ dated system for funding America &apos;s major roads .
The usually dull ar@@ ena of high@@ way planning has suddenly sp@@ aw@@ ned intense debate and color@@ ful alli@@ ances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lo@@ b@@ b@@ ying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is ag@@ hast .
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of priv@@ acy issues .
And while Congress can &apos;@@ t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are expl@@ oring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which dri@@ vers pay per m@@ ile of road they roll over .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of mot@@ or@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have G@@ PS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
&quot; It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said Has@@ an I@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , executive director of the Southern Cali@@ for@@ nia Ass@@ n@@ . of Governments , which is planning for the state to start trac@@ king miles driven by every Cali@@ for@@ nia mot@@ or@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country &apos;s Highway Trust Fund , fin@@ anced with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don &apos;@@ t buy as much gas as they used to .
C@@ ars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;@@ t gone up in 20 years .
Pol@@ itici@@ ans are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one pen@@ ny when gas prices are high .
&quot; The gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said L@@ ee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Min@@ nes@@ ota .
His state recently put trac@@ king devices on 500 cars to test out a pay@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ m@@ ile system .
&quot; This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call it a mil@@ eag@@ e-@@ based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be rig@@ ged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce con@@ g@@ estion and green@@ house gases , for example .
Cali@@ for@@ nia pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
But Rep@@ . Bill Sh@@ ust@@ er ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a . ) , chairman of the House Tran@@ spor@@ tation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-@@ term alternative .
The free mark@@ et@@ e@@ ers at the Re@@ as@@ on Foundation are also fond of having dri@@ vers pay per m@@ ile .
&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Ad@@ ri@@ an Mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at Re@@ as@@ on .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U@@ .@@ S. Tran@@ spor@@ tation secret@@ aries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ m@@ ile direction .
The U@@ .@@ S. Sen@@ ate approved a $ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10@@ ,@@ 000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve lo@@ gging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are non@@ e@@ theless moving ahead on their own .
The most eager is O@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ li@@ sting 5,@@ 000 dri@@ vers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .
Those dri@@ vers will soon pay the mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying it on a limited basis with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 Co@@ al@@ ition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Se@@ ab@@ o@@ ard ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Vir@@ gin@@ ia and Fl@@ or@@ ida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In N@@ ev@@ ada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , dri@@ vers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; Con@@ cer@@ ns about Big Bro@@ ther and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said A@@ la@@ uddin Khan , who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the N@@ ev@@ ada Department of Tran@@ spor@@ tation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got under@@ way , the AC@@ L@@ U of N@@ ev@@ ada warned on its website : &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into ful@@ l@@ -@@ fle@@ d@@ ged trac@@ king devices . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday com@@ ings and go@@ ings .
N@@ ev@@ ada is among several states now scr@@ am@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small Cali@@ for@@ nia startup called True Mil@@ e@@ age .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax dri@@ vers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which dri@@ vers would pay based on their mil@@ e@@ age .
But the devices it is testing appeal to high@@ way pl@@ ann@@ ers because they don &apos;@@ t use G@@ PS and deliver a limited amount of information , uplo@@ aded periodic@@ ally by mo@@ dem .
&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said R@@ yan Mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of True Mil@@ e@@ age .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving dri@@ vers different cho@@ ices .
They can choose a device with or without G@@ PS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hop@@ ing to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay par@@ king meter fees , provide &quot; pay@@ -@@ as@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real@@ -@@ time speed data from other dri@@ vers that mot@@ or@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; Mot@@ or@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
Some transportation pl@@ ann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the m@@ ile is just a giant distr@@ action .
At the Met@@ ropolitan Tran@@ spor@@ tation Commission in the San Franc@@ isco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rup@@ t Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra on@@ e-@@ time or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on dri@@ vers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;@@ t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspir@@ in , &quot; said R@@ and@@ y R@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of dri@@ vers will be concerned about their priv@@ acy and a host of other things .
According to the police his death was due to drow@@ ning .
However , the police have taken the friend of the deceased into custody for hiding the deceased &apos;s l@@ ug@@ gage at his house .
The police have filed the final investigation report with the court .
It may be recalled that on August 26@@ th the police recovered the body of Ja@@ hid Iq@@ bal from the J@@ hel@@ um river in Pad@@ sha@@ hi Park .
His family had accused his friends because his mobile and other l@@ ug@@ gage was missing .
The police said in their report that the deceased &apos;s phone and SI@@ M card were checked and his phone was being used by a woman named Sa@@ ura .
After ques@@ tioning the woman , she said that the phone had been given to her by a relative named Ru@@ ha@@ il G@@ au@@ har .
Ru@@ ha@@ il also lives in Pad@@ sha@@ hi Park and was a friend of the deceased .
On August 25@@ th , after Nam@@ a@@ az@@ -@@ e-@@ J@@ um@@ ma , Ru@@ ha@@ il had gone with Ja@@ hid to ba@@ the in the J@@ hel@@ um river .
Ja@@ hid took off his clothes and left all his things on the banks , while Ru@@ ha@@ il went to the other bank to smoke a ci@@ gare@@ t@@ te .
When he returned Ja@@ hid was not there , only his clothes were there .
Ru@@ ha@@ il looked for Ja@@ hid , but he could not find him .
Then he picked up his mobile phone , watch and other things and kept them for his own use .
He did not tell anyone that Ja@@ hid has drowned .
The police told the court that Ja@@ hid has drowned and the post@@ -@@ mor@@ tem report confirmed this .
However , Ru@@ ha@@ il was arrested under section 4@@ 04 for hiding the facts and possessions of the deceased .

After receiving the water pur@@ i@@ fier from the company representatives J@@ .@@ K.

The 77 year old former Italian Prime Minister , Sil@@ vi@@ o Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i , known for his B@@ un@@ ga B@@ un@@ ga parties , has married a 28 year old girl in an extremely secre@@ tive manner .
This was revealed by a family friend , Mar@@ y@@ the@@ ll Pol@@ anc@@ o .
According to her , the three times Prime Minister Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i has married former TV anch@@ or Franc@@ is@@ ca Pas@@ cale in his private cha@@ pel .
Franc@@ is@@ ca met Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i when she was a te@@ en@@ age activ@@ ist with the For@@ za Ital@@ ia Party .
This is the same Franc@@ is@@ ca , about whom it has been said that her relationship with Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i is a sha@@ m .
Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i &apos;s close friend and the B@@ un@@ ga B@@ un@@ ga Gir@@ l Mar@@ y@@ the@@ ll Pol@@ anc@@ o revealed that she was also invited to this secret wedding .
This ceremony took place three weeks ago .
During the revelation on Italian Radio 2 , when Pol@@ anc@@ o was asked what would happen if those two were to get married , Pol@@ anc@@ o replied that they are already married .
This was not a public ceremony .
This wedding was held in the cha@@ pel at the former Prime Minister &apos;s home .
Other than this , no one can say anything more .
However , she did not go to the wedding .
She had sent her best wishes to the new@@ ly@@ we@@ ds .
They got married about three weeks ago on October 8th or 9th .
He got engaged about 8 months ago to the 28 year old woman , Franc@@ es@@ ca Pas@@ cale , who is 50 years younger than him .
To avoid embarr@@ assment , Ber@@ l@@ us@@ con@@ i claimed lon@@ el@@ iness as the reason for his decision to marry .
Between the hide and seek with the sun , rain continued in low@@ -@@ lying areas .
This created a cold front in the valley .
The cold could be gau@@ ged by the fact that the minimum temperature at Sh@@ rin@@ agar was 4.@@ 8 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us , in G@@ ul@@ mar@@ g it was below 0 at -@@ 0.2 degrees and in Le@@ h it reached -@@ 1.@@ 8 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .
Le@@ h was the cool@@ est place in the whole state .
However , due to rain and snow the str@@ ateg@@ ically important Srin@@ agar to Le@@ h national high@@ way has been closed to traffic .
There is heavy s@@ now@@ fall in the Jo@@ z@@ illa Pass .
This is the fourth s@@ now@@ fall of the season in the Kashmir valley and the first heavy s@@ now@@ fall .
Due to the western disturb@@ ance activity , since the early hours of Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day the higher hilly regions have experienced some s@@ now@@ fall and the low lying areas had rainfall , that continued until late into the evening .
Normal life has also been affected by the cold .
People remained in their homes to avoid the cold .
Meanwhile , the electricity supply has also failed in this area .
The day temper@@ atures in Sh@@ rin@@ agar were four degrees below normal and were recorded at 13@@ .@@ 7 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .
Due to the rains along with strong winds in Jammu in the early morning of Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , the cold increased at night .
A minimum temperature of 16@@ .@@ 6 and a maximum temperature of 27@@ .0 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us were recorded in Jammu .
According to the weather department , the influence of the western disturb@@ ances is dec@@ lining and the weather will improve by Friday .
According to the Sh@@ rin@@ agar weather department &apos;s Director , Son@@ am Lo@@ ts , the weather in the valley from November the first to the seventh is expected to be dry .
As@@ aram , j@@ ailed on sexual assa@@ ult charges , was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday .
It was pleaded on behalf of As@@ aram that the media coverage is presenting him as a kind of D@@ rac@@ ula drinking the blood of children , but the Supreme Court denied his request to ban the media coverage .
Chief Judge P. Sat@@ shi@@ v@@ am &apos;s panel refused to ban the media coverage about As@@ aram and said that they had read every word reported by the media and had not found anything objec@@ tionable in it .
When they are receiving information from the police and other people how can we stop them ?
Before that As@@ aram &apos;s lawyers accused the media of showing highly bi@@ ased news .
The country has so many newspapers and news channels .
They cannot file cases against every one of them , but the panel was not influenced by this plea and refused to file a complaint , saying that they had other options too .
The Court has already previously denied As@@ aram &apos;s request to ban the media coverage .
The officers of the department claim that this is the biggest case of T@@ DS the@@ ft to date .
The director of the M@@ all group made payments to all the financial institutions after deduc@@ ting the T@@ DS , but did not deposit it in the government treas@@ ury .
In this way he kept the accumulated T@@ DS amount .
The Mumbai Income Tax team , along with the team from the Jaipur Income tax department , ra@@ ided this group on October 17th .
During the investigation of this group it was revealed that this business@@ man had deduc@@ ted the T@@ DS but had not paid it in .
This is why the T@@ DS team initiated an income tax survey of this group .
About 15 days before , ra@@ ids and a survey was carried out on the m@@ all &apos;s group of directors , before there was any risk of the accounts being sealed .
An@@ gry with these actions , the business@@ man clearly told the officers of the income tax department that he is not ready to pay the T@@ DS amount due to the income tax department right now .
The Income tax department is continuing to target him and take action .
In this case the officers have explained that if payment is not made the accounts will be fro@@ zen and a recovery procedure will be initiated .
As Diwali is approaching the demand for d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts has increased .
Because of this , the sale of sub@@ standard and counter@@ fe@@ it milk sol@@ ids has increased .
To make the d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts gl@@ os@@ sy , colour@@ ful and sweet , chemicals that are harmful for the health are being used , .
The Food and Dru@@ g Administration Department has launched a campaign against f@@ ake milk sol@@ ids and chemical based d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts .
The department has seized R@@ s@@ .@@ 70 thousand worth of milk sol@@ ids brought in from Madhya Pradesh and Rs 5 thousand worth ch@@ um ch@@ um from the Qu@@ ett@@ a Col@@ ony .
With the increase in demand of d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts in the market the demand for f@@ ake milk sol@@ ids from Madhya Pradesh has also increased .
The department received a tip off that sub@@ standard milk sol@@ ids were being brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur and stored in soil .
The milk sol@@ ids were brought from the transport gar@@ age to Nagpur .
The milk sol@@ ids seized by the department were reported to be worth R@@ s@@ .@@ 70 thousand .
No one has claimed the milk sol@@ ids due to the risk of legal action .
The department has destroyed the same as it was considered un@@ claimed ( unknown ) .
The department ra@@ ided J@@ it@@ endra C@@ ater@@ ers in the Qu@@ ett@@ a Col@@ ony and seized ch@@ um ch@@ um worth around R@@ s@@ .5 thousand .
A chemical named so@@ dium hydro@@ -@@ sulph@@ ate is used to make the ch@@ um ch@@ um sh@@ iny and more lasting .
A sample has been sent to the laboratory .
The jo@@ int@@ -@@ commission@@ er of the department , S@@ .@@ S. Desh@@ muk@@ h , said that the campaign to seize chemical based d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts and sub@@ standard or counter@@ fe@@ it milk sol@@ ids will continue .
The department also said that in the next few days this campaign would intensi@@ fy .
The consumption of these d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts can cause pois@@ oning .
The department has asked tr@@ ad@@ es@@ men to use good milk and milk sol@@ ids when making d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts .
An appeal has been made on behalf of the department to the public to beware of f@@ ake d@@ ess@@ er@@ ts .
42 selected senior leaders of the state BJP unit gave him a grand reception at the airport .
It is note@@ worthy that Mo@@ di was here on a con@@ sol@@ ation tour in Bihar organised by the BJP .
The con@@ sol@@ ation tour was an exercise organised by the BJP to con@@ sole the families of the victims of the Patna bomb bla@@ sts .
It is note@@ worthy that a total of 7 bomb bla@@ sts occurred one after the other during Narendra Mo@@ di &apos;s Hun@@ k@@ aar r@@ ally on October 27@@ th .
Indian Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ide@@ en terrorists involved in the bomb@@ ings had intended to cause a st@@ am@@ pe@@ de during the r@@ ally , so that more people would die and to spread pan@@ ic in the state .
The terrorists inten@@ tions were th@@ war@@ ted but six people died in the bla@@ sts .
They all have been declared to be martyr@@ s by the BJP .
An ur@@ n tour was organized from their village by the party leaders on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Their remains were buried in the Ganges in Patna on November 5th .
The con@@ sol@@ ation tour was a part of this tour .
The main player in this was Narendra Mo@@ di .
He will be going to the villages of the people killed in the bomb bla@@ sts to meet the families .
During this meeting and visit he will be don@@ ating chequ@@ es worth five lakh rupees to each family of the deceased .
This financial aid has been already announced by the BJP .
When the exciting Indian team plays at the M. Chin@@ n@@ asw@@ amy St@@ adium after their spectac@@ ular win in the last match for the seventh and last on@@ e-@@ day against Australia , they will be aim@@ ing to win this match and win the series .
After rains washed out the last two on@@ e-@@ day matches , they had to win the Nagpur on@@ e-@@ day for India to remain in the series , and its bat@@ smen played an amazing game and had a record win , lev@@ elling the series at 2@@ -@@ 2 .
In this series team India has achieved the target of 3@@ 50 or more runs twice and once again the responsibility to save the team lies with the bat@@ smen .
Indian bat@@ ting is at its peak now and even the bigger targets seem small to them .
Ro@@ hit Sharma , Shi@@ k@@ har Dha@@ wan , Vir@@ at Ko@@ h@@ ile and Mah@@ endra Singh D@@ hon@@ i are in great form , but the team also has high expectations of Y@@ uv@@ raj Singh , Su@@ resh R@@ ain@@ a and Rav@@ indra Jad@@ e@@ ja .
As far as opening is concerned , the opening pair of Ro@@ hit and Shi@@ k@@ har is making the job easier for the other bat@@ smen , with their strong partnership .
They gave Vir@@ at the opportunity to bat without any pressure in Jaipur and Nagpur with their remarkable opening partnership .
Given the great performance by Vir@@ at up until now at No@@ .@@ 3 , he is being seen as the future Sach@@ in Tend@@ ulkar .
Actually , a lot of cricket gre@@ ats have said that he is better than Sach@@ in .
Vir@@ at , who is completing 25 years next week , has sco@@ red 17 on@@ e-@@ day centuries out of which 16 have lead to an Indian victory .
While cha@@ sing a target his average is above 80 and he has emerged as a excellent fin@@ isher .
The top three bat@@ men of India are in great form , but too much reliance on these three can also be dam@@ aging for the team .
R@@ ain@@ a and Y@@ uv@@ raj were very bo@@ g flo@@ ps in the last match .
Y@@ uv@@ raj could not even open his account in the two matches of the series .
Because of this , a good in@@ nings at the Beng@@ al@@ uru on@@ e-@@ day would be a &apos; lifel@@ ine &apos; for him .
As far as Australia team is concerned , their bat@@ smen especially Cap@@ tain George B@@ ail@@ ey , has impressed everyone with his perform@@ ances .
There has been demand to include him in the Home Ash@@ es test team against England .
Australia has good bat@@ smen up to number nine .
Besides of B@@ ail@@ ey , Sh@@ ane Wat@@ son , Gl@@ en@@ n Max@@ well , Adam V@@ og@@ es and James Fa@@ ul@@ k@@ ner have bat@@ ted well in the series .
Although P@@ hil Hu@@ gh and Er@@ on Fin@@ ch haven &apos;@@ t been able to make an impression at the opening .
However , the absence of bow@@ ler Michael Joh@@ n@@ son could make things difficult .
Joh@@ n@@ son , who had been performing well until now in the series , has been sent home to prepare for the Ash@@ es series .
BJP national executive member and chief spo@@ k@@ es@@ person , Dr J@@ it@@ endra Singh , said Pakistan is now working on a new strategy to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ation of terrorist groups under the gu@@ ise of peace .
C@@ iting reports from intelligence agencies , Singh said in a statement issued on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that Pakistan is leaving no stone un@@ turned in trying to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate 2,@@ 000 terrorists trained in their training c@@ amps .
That is why they will never allow peace to prevail on the border .
After the separ@@ ati@@ sts inten@@ tions of prov@@ o@@ king the people in Kashmir and spreading widespread un@@ rest failed , Pakistan has become more un@@ ru@@ ly .
C@@ iting the Pakistan tour of the separ@@ ati@@ st the BJP leader said that the IS@@ I chief , L@@ t. G@@ en Z@@ a@@ he@@ er@@ -@@ ul@@ -@@ Islam , L@@ ash@@ kar , H@@ iz@@ b chief &apos;s H@@ af@@ ee@@ z S@@ ay@@ eed and Sa@@ iy@@ ad Sal@@ la@@ h@@ uddin have predic@@ ted a rise in terrorism in 2014 .
Pakistan is seriously trying to complete this promise .
The killing of soldiers on the border and suicide bomb@@ ings in Sam@@ ba , H@@ ir@@ an@@ agar are part of the same strategy .
While st@@ ating that under these circumstances demand for the sus@@ pension of the special rights of the army would be dangerous , he said that saying such things before things cool down in the state is also not in the public interest .
This would ab@@ et the anti@@ -@@ national elements .
He stressed that the leaders should stop making statements that reduce the mor@@ ale of the army and security forces .
S@@ now@@ den ready to &quot; co@@ operate &quot; with Germany over US sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the US intelligence wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , has declared that he is willing to travel to Ber@@ lin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Ke@@ ith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German MP H@@ ans@@ -@@ Christian Str@@ ö@@ bel@@ e on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day met Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted as@@ yl@@ um , to discuss him testi@@ fying in Germany .
A letter from Mr S@@ now@@ den , presented to the media in Ber@@ lin on Friday by the MP , said : &quot; Though the outcome of my efforts has been demon@@ str@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .
In the letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
The charges filed by the US justice department include es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of government property .
H@@ ans@@ -@@ Pet@@ er Fri@@ ed@@ rich , German inter@@ ior minister , told Z@@ e@@ it Online : &quot; If Mr S@@ now@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the N@@ SA bu@@ g@@ ged Chancell@@ or Ang@@ ela &apos;s Mer@@ k@@ el &apos;s phone .
Thomas Op@@ perman@@ n , the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the US , &quot; it should be taken .
Mr Str@@ ö@@ bel@@ e , an MP for Germany &apos;s Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter feed .
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journ@@ alists .
Mr Str@@ ö@@ bel@@ e said that , according to the former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor &apos;s lawyer , Mr S@@ now@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany he would need ass@@ ur@@ ances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the MP said .
Mr S@@ now@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persec@@ ution that forced him from his home .
However he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
Citiz@@ ens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an un@@ accountable system of perv@@ asi@@ ve sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance to be a public service .

Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines to charge for car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store car@@ r@@ y-@@ on l@@ ug@@ gage on board their flight .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
The new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee is for bags in the over@@ head bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
Fron@@ tier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if trav@@ el@@ ers wait to pay until they &apos;@@ re at the gate .
Fron@@ tier spo@@ k@@ es@@ woman K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the $ 100 fee is to get trav@@ el@@ ers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; We don &apos;@@ t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
Air@@ lines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
Pass@@ engers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ffing as much as they can into car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage st@@ ashed in over@@ head b@@ ins , meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space .
F@@ ees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
It &apos;s about Fron@@ tier &apos;s most loyal customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head bin space has become increasingly difficult .
Pass@@ engers who buy their tic@@ kets on the air@@ line &apos;s website won &apos;@@ t have to pay .
That means one passenger in line at a Fron@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might owe $ 100 for a similar bag .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said Fron@@ tier &apos;s website and check@@ -@@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee won &apos;@@ t start until summer , though a date has@@ n &apos;@@ t been set .
Pass@@ engers often gr@@ um@@ ble about bag@@ gage charges and other fees , but air@@ lines love them .
They argue that l@@ ug@@ gage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
Many on W@@ all Street view the addition of bag@@ gage fees as a sign that air@@ lines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Most haven &apos;@@ t touched car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fees , though .
Spirit Air@@ lines In@@ c. started the first car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter Al@@ legi@@ ant Air later followed .
The only other air@@ line with such a fee is Hun@@ gary &apos;s W@@ iz@@ z Air , said air@@ line consul@@ tant J@@ ay Sor@@ ens@@ en , who closely tracks add@@ -@@ on fees .
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ ens@@ en , a former executive with Mid@@ west Air@@ lines , fle@@ w Spirit recently and won@@ dered what he &apos;@@ d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fee .
&quot; The bo@@ arding process was the sm@@ oo@@ the@@ st I had seen in my air@@ line career , &quot; he said .
I was exp@@ ecting to see gn@@ ashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
The plane was full , he said , &quot; and it bo@@ ar@@ ded l@@ ick@@ et@@ y-@@ split . &quot;
Fron@@ tier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier said passengers who get so@@ da or ju@@ ice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free .
It will still give away water .
US Air@@ ways bri@@ efly tried charging for b@@ ever@@ ages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers compl@@ ained and no other major air@@ line followed .
Fron@@ tier &apos;s move to charge the car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee if passengers don &apos;@@ t buy direct from the air@@ line is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website .
Air@@ lines pay online travel sel@@ lers such as Or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
That has given all air@@ lines an inc@@ entive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
Fron@@ tier has gone the fur@@ the@@ st in this area , though .
In September it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
On W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day it sl@@ ashed the mil@@ e@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
So , a 1,@@ 000 m@@ ile Fron@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fron@@ tier website .
Fron@@ tier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Den@@ ver , but its business is shr@@ inking and losing money .
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity sh@@ rank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day by corporate parent Republic Air@@ ways Hol@@ dings Inc .
Republic has been trying to fix Fron@@ tier &apos;s fin@@ ances as part of selling the air@@ line .
N@@ SA B@@ lam@@ es &quot; Internal Error , &quot; Not H@@ ack@@ ers , For Website Cr@@ ash
The shad@@ ow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a gl@@ itch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not ha@@ ck@@ ers as some claimed online .
&quot; N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v was not accessible for several hours ton@@ ight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ailed statement .
The issue will be resolved this evening .
Cla@@ ims that the out@@ age was caused by a distributed denial of service &#91; D@@ Do@@ S &#93; attack are not true .
Ear@@ lier this evening online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noted the N@@ SA &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some users .
Ear@@ lier an N@@ SA spo@@ k@@ es@@ person told A@@ BC News the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; com@@ promised .
No classified information is in danger , the spo@@ k@@ es@@ person said .
At least one ha@@ ck@@ tiv@@ ist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is a relatively un@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penet@@ rate the internal network of the target system .
The form@@ erly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once n@@ ick@@ named No Such Agency , has found itself in very public light , and amid vic@@ ious criticism , in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance programs - collectively the product of secret N@@ SA files stol@@ en from the agency and le@@ aked by dis@@ ench@@ anted former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early spec@@ ulation that ton@@ ight &apos;s incident was the result of a targ@@ eted cy@@ ber operation .
A wonderful performance was given at the show &quot; E@@ k aur D@@ ron@@ acharya &quot; showing the resem@@ bl@@ ance between the D@@ wa@@ ap@@ ar y@@ ug and today .
It showed how , in today &apos;s world , a teacher can be forced to follow the wrong path in com@@ promising circumstances .
The play was inaugurated in the St. Joseph Inter College aud@@ it@@ orium jointly by Chief Gu@@ est M@@ L@@ A Pr@@ abh@@ day@@ al Valmiki , C@@ ant@@ on@@ ment Board Vice-@@ president Shi@@ pr@@ a R@@ ast@@ og@@ i , N@@ resh K@@ ans@@ al and Shakti Singh .
The play showed the simil@@ arities between the conditions in D@@ ron@@ acharya in the D@@ wa@@ ap@@ aar age and followed a professor called Ar@@ v@@ ind in the present day .
The play directed by An@@ il Sharma , Bharat B@@ hushan Sharma , An@@ il Sharma , Vin@@ od Bec@@ ha@@ in , Hem@@ ant Go@@ el , Se@@ ema Sam@@ ar , Van@@ sh@@ id@@ har Chat@@ ur@@ ved@@ i , Ab@@ id Sam@@ my , Shiva Ghaz@@ ala , Am@@ it , Ram@@ esh , Arjun etc. did full justice to the characters and was a spectac@@ ular show .
The theatre lighting was handled by a young artist , J@@ it@@ endra C. Raj , and the set was designed by Hem@@ ant Kumar .
After this function on behalf of AP@@ TA , many awards were presented to various literary and cultural person@@ alities .
The head of the Urdu Department of Char@@ an Singh University , Dr. As@@ lam Jam@@ sh@@ ed@@ puri , Senior Jour@@ n@@ alist Sha@@ mb@@ hun@@ ath Sh@@ uk@@ la and theatre design@@ er J@@ it@@ endra C. Raj were awarded on this occasion .
Among the officials of the executive committee , secretary Sur@@ endra Sharma , Rak@@ esh K@@ aus@@ hi@@ k , Ab@@ id R@@ iz@@ vi etc . , contributed to the success of the program .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er profit di@@ ps as plane deliver@@ ies , orders fall
Can@@ a@@ dian plane and train maker B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , pres@@ su@@ red by fe@@ wer aircraft orders and deliver@@ ies in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
Mon@@ tre@@ al@@ -@@ based B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er also did not release any flight test data for its br@@ and@@ -@@ new C@@ Series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
After the test plane &apos;s inaug@@ ural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flow@@ n three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
Res@@ ults fell short of forec@@ asts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the Tor@@ onto Stock Exchange .
Cam@@ er@@ on Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , an analy@@ st with National Bank Financial , low@@ ered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; While the weaker aircraft deliver@@ ies were mostly anticip@@ ated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a client note .
We believe that B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er will receive new orders for the C@@ Series as the flight test program progres@@ ses .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we susp@@ ect that the market will become more sk@@ ep@@ tical of the program .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes the C@@ Series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Air@@ bus .
The first test plane was un@@ veiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of del@@ ays .
But firm orders for the C@@ Series are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential bu@@ yers wait for flight test results to valid@@ ate the company &apos;s claims about the new j@@ et@@ lin@@ er &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
There are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commit@@ ments with 15 customers and oper@@ ators .
Chief Executive Officer Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ do@@ in was confident B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first j@@ et is put into commercial use .
Exec@@ u@@ tives also reas@@ su@@ red analy@@ sts and media on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day the program was progres@@ sing according to schedule .
&quot; The test plane didn &apos;@@ t stay on the ground longer than anticip@@ ated , &quot; Be@@ au@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s down@@ time .
Every manufac@@ turer sch@@ ed@@ ules it in a different way .
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
That will happen all through the flight program .
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remainder following shor@@ tly after , the company said .
Still , analy@@ sts are sk@@ ep@@ tical the first customer can begin operating a C@@ Series plane 12 months after its maid@@ en flight .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er said it was eval@@ uating the entr@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service ( E@@ IS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s internal schedule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that entr@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service will be pushed to Q@@ 1 / 15 , &quot; said Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
For the third quarter ended September 30 , B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .
Ad@@ just@@ ed earnings per share were un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
Revenue di@@ pped mar@@ gin@@ ally to $ 4.1 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
An@@ aly@@ sts had expected earnings of 10 c@@ ents per share and revenue of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to Thom@@ son Re@@ ut@@ ers I / B / E / S .
The world &apos;s four@@ th-@@ largest plan@@ em@@ aker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier .
N@@ et orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .
The back@@ log in the a@@ eros@@ pace division was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion as of September 30 , un@@ changed from December 31 .
&quot; In a@@ eros@@ pace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order int@@ ake and overall market conditions were a dis@@ appointment , &quot; Be@@ au@@ do@@ in said .
A@@ eros@@ pace revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world &apos;s largest train@@ maker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2@@ .1 billion .
The order back@@ log in the transportation unit was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion as of September 30 , up mar@@ gin@@ ally from December 31 .
The transportation division &apos;s mar@@ gins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .
Exec@@ u@@ tives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .
Sha@@ res of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Pat@@ ric@@ k P@@ ich@@ ette would join the board , were down 8@@ .5 percent at C $ 4.@@ 83 in mid afternoon trading on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Brazil &apos;s Em@@ bra@@ er SA , the world &apos;s thir@@ d@@ -@@ largest commercial plan@@ em@@ aker and B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s clos@@ est ri@@ val , reported a 10 percent fall in quar@@ terly profit on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
New research has revealed that we work with complete hon@@ esty and dedication in the morning hours .
Th@@ ough@@ ts of lying to anyone and the@@ ft or che@@ ating someone do not enter our heads .
But as the evening comes , our minds change and we set aside our principles and we go against the accepted norms .
In research carried out by Har@@ v@@ ard University and the David A@@ x@@ le School of Business , U@@ ta@@ h , researchers have revealed some interesting facts .
According to researchers , while we don &apos;@@ t have work pressure in the morning we attach importance to moral values , but as the evening sets in , due to fatigue or extra pressure our hon@@ esty dec@@ lines .
To test this researchers did two experiments .
They asked some subjects to count the number of do@@ ts on a computer screen .
For example , subjects had to say if the do@@ ts were more on the right or le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side .
Particip@@ ants were then told that if they give the wrong answer rather than the correct answer they would be given money .
This experiment shows that those who took part in the experiment in the morning between 8 and 12 did not make any mistakes and they gave the correct answers .
At the same time , those who took part in the experiment between 12 noon and 6@@ pm set aside their mor@@ als and inten@@ tionally gave wrong answers .
Res@@ ear@@ chers have succeeded in proving that in the morning the gre@@ ed for money does not affect our hon@@ esty , but in the evening we chose to ignore morality .
The research is published in the current issue of P@@ sych@@ ological Science .

C@@ oc@@ ain@@ e-@@ ad@@ dict lawyer who ti@@ pped off Mr Big about police investigation is j@@ ailed
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed information to crime lord Ne@@ il S@@ car@@ br@@ ough
The solic@@ itor feared his secret drug ad@@ diction would be exposed
Was given a th@@ ree@@ -@@ year prison sentence at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he feared his secret drug ad@@ diction would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ har@@ at D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Ne@@ il S@@ car@@ br@@ ough about in@@ qui@@ ries into his drug tra@@ ffic@@ king activities after he became com@@ promised by his coc@@ ain@@ e habit .
The solic@@ itor , who was n@@ ick@@ named &quot; B@@ ash &quot; and ha@@ iled by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance operation into S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ co@@ tics trial .
Officers sp@@ otted Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 , drop@@ ping off three bags of coc@@ ain@@ e at the lawyer &apos;s home in Bl@@ ack@@ burn , L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
In@@ qui@@ ries revealed D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the Class A drug after tests found trac@@ es of coc@@ ain@@ e in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to ill@@ ic@@ itly obtain information on the arre@@ sts of two men on behalf of S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough as well as one of his associates .
All four susp@@ ects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and coc@@ ain@@ e r@@ ack@@ et operating across L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire , C@@ umb@@ ri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ ksh@@ ire and West Yor@@ ksh@@ ire .
They and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police seized hero@@ in and coc@@ ain@@ e worth £ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than £ 200@@ ,@@ 000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
D@@ it@@ ta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his coc@@ ain@@ e ad@@ diction would be exposed
Today at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court D@@ it@@ ta , who works at law firm For@@ bes Sol@@ ic@@ itors , based in Bl@@ ack@@ burn , was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two coun@@ ts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Li@@ ver@@ pool Crown Court .
He admitted coc@@ ain@@ e possession at an earlier hearing .
The lawyer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investig@@ ating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two det@@ ec@@ tives tr@@ ailed the susp@@ ect and sp@@ otted him arri@@ ving at D@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s b@@ ins in a black g@@ olf g@@ love .
Soon after the drop off , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was in regular phone contact with D@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the Bl@@ ack@@ burn Ro@@ vers foot@@ ball st@@ adium , E@@ wood Park .
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
The court heard D@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of coc@@ ain@@ e after tests found trac@@ es of the Class A drug in his hair , wal@@ let and on his credit cards
D@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied using coc@@ ain@@ e and and said he had been speaking to the susp@@ ected deal@@ er because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;
During his arrest D@@ it@@ ta picked up his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken f@@ om him .
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arre@@ sts to tell them what det@@ ec@@ tives knew about them .
Pro@@ sec@@ uting , Ann@@ e Wh@@ y@@ te said : &quot; If anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solic@@ itor . &quot;
Mr D@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal solic@@ itor , having become too involved with specific clients .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug deal@@ er , but a drug deal@@ er providing his own lawyer with drugs .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
But this went way beyond the ordinary con@@ fin@@ es of a law@@ y@@ er@@ -@@ client relationship .
He th@@ war@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ ouring his profession , but dis@@ hon@@ ouring it .
He got too close to certain clients , in particular S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
D@@ it@@ ta denied wrongdoing and claimed : &quot; If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . &quot;
But after the hearing Sup@@ t L@@ ee Hal@@ stead from L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire Police said : &quot; Mr D@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal solic@@ itor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals . &quot;
His ad@@ diction to coc@@ ain@@ e left him hop@@ el@@ essly com@@ promised and vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who t@@ asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investig@@ ations .
Sol@@ ic@@ itors should up@@ hold the highest standards of integrity and should insti@@ l trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ it@@ ta has betra@@ yed this trust and attempted to hide behind the ven@@ eer of his profession .
L@@ anc@@ ash@@ ire &apos;s Ser@@ ious and Organ@@ ised Cri@@ me Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convic@@ ted of three coun@@ ts of possession of coc@@ ain@@ e and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice , demon@@ strating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
We will find you and put you before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was j@@ ailed for 14 years after ple@@ ading guilty to conspiracy to supply hero@@ in , coc@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty five other men involved in the r@@ ack@@ et were j@@ ailed for a total of 15@@ 3 years for drugs offences .
On his website D@@ it@@ ta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his f@@ ant@@ asy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America , his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and in@@ equality as his motiv@@ ation for work .
Ken@@ yan press ou@@ tr@@ aged at contro@@ versi@@ al media law
&quot; It is a frigh@@ tening place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply swe@@ eping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; This law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ itive and we reject it , &quot; said Cyr@@ us Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Cap@@ it@@ al@@ F@@ M , one of Ken@@ ya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
He said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be bi@@ ased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertis@@ ing would damage Ken@@ ya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MP@@ s , &quot; he said .
According to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a strang@@ le@@ hold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Ken@@ ya had been &quot; dealt a major blow &quot; and lam@@ b@@ asted the bill as &quot; dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian . &quot;
The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to rein@@ force national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islam@@ ist gun@@ men on the West@@ gate shopping m@@ all .
Ken@@ ya media drew the ire of authorities by broad@@ casting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were dis@@ pat@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ por@@ tedly rob@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all .
Police chief David K@@ im@@ ai@@ yo re@@ acted by summon@@ ing two journ@@ alists and a media executive for ques@@ tioning , although the summ@@ ons was re@@ tracted following a media out@@ cry .
Under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and individual journ@@ alists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de@@ -@@ listed , &quot; or barred from receiving official press ac@@ cred@@ itation .
The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an off@@ ender if a fine is not paid .
According to the Daily Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to crip@@ ple most F@@ M stations . &quot;
It also said the measures could have a devast@@ ating effect on what it described as Ken@@ ya &apos;s &quot; li@@ vely b@@ log@@ os@@ phere . &quot;
By sil@@ encing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with im@@ pun@@ ity .
&quot; No one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journ@@ alist Mut@@ uma Ma@@ thi@@ u , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of chec@@ ks and balances in public life .
&quot; Left to themselves , politicians would bank@@ rup@@ t the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , &quot; he wrote .
Ken@@ yan law@@ makers have been the target of public anger in the past .
In May they v@@ oted to over@@ turn cuts ordered by the national sal@@ aries commission and rein@@ state their he@@ fty sal@@ aries of around 5@@ 3@@ 2,@@ 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings a month tax@@ -@@ free - ran@@ ked among the highest in the world .

same way 13@@ 5 lux@@ ury cars were also used , including B@@ M@@ W@@ s and Jag@@ u@@ ars .
S@@ ood said that the city &apos;s sanitation system and street lights had totally broken down .
No steps were being taken by the municipal corporation and H@@ U@@ DA to run Pan@@ ch@@ k@@ ula city centre .
He demanded the complete abol@@ ition of house tax in Pan@@ ch@@ k@@ ula .
On Friday , while addressing a press conference here , V@@ .@@ K. S@@ ood said that , after the municipal corporation elections the city got a new coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or and may@@ or , but they do not have the powers necessary to get the work done .
So the city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors have become du@@ mm@@ ies and officers are doing as they pleased .
S@@ ood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees at its disposal , but all the money is in the form of Bank F@@ Ds and interest is being earned on it .
So no steps are being taken to use that money for the development of the city .
V@@ .@@ K. S@@ ood said the refuse dum@@ p issue is the most serious problem .
By creating a dum@@ p in Sector 23 , people living in sectors beyond Gha@@ gg@@ ar are forced to live a h@@ ell@@ ish life .
The municipal corporation officers have been talking about shi@@ fting the dum@@ p to the village of J@@ hur@@ i@@ wala for the past several years now , but the inhabitants of the Bar@@ wala area are already facing a serious problem with flies .
He said that healthcare and educational facilities are extremely bad .
No work has yet been started to provide facilities for rural inhabitants .
UN ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplom@@ ats played a key role in p@@ ushing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the MD@@ G@@ s , which exp@@ ire in 2015 , ahead of the UN sustainable development summ@@ it that began in Ri@@ o de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o o@@ vern@@ ight .
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endor@@ sed by world leaders including Ms G@@ ill@@ ard during the summ@@ it .
UN Secret@@ ar@@ y-@@ General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ moon told the summ@@ it o@@ vern@@ ight that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - S@@ DG@@ s , &quot; he said .
These S@@ DG@@ s will build on our advances under the mill@@ enni@@ um development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post@@ -@@ 2015 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MD@@ G@@ s .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities cl@@ ash
With a stat@@ ue of Sam@@ ora Mac@@ he@@ l , Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s founding president , star@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to ch@@ ant peace slog@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; We want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said Van@@ ess@@ a de S@@ ous@@ a , chief executive of an investment company .
F@@ ear@@ ful about the future of her country , she sw@@ apped her corporate at@@ ti@@ re for a T@@ -@@ shirt emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capital &apos;s Independence Squ@@ are on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of cl@@ ashes between government forces and Ren@@ am@@ o , some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
Ren@@ am@@ o was once a no@@ torious rebel movement , initially backed by wh@@ it@@ e-@@ ruled R@@ ho@@ des@@ ia and then South Africa &apos;s apar@@ the@@ id government as part of efforts to dest@@ ab@@ il@@ ise the country &apos;s independent government .
After a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts believe the country is un@@ likely to sli@@ de back into ful@@ l@@ -@@ blown conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and local@@ s .
The st@@ akes are high for the fast@@ -@@ growing economy as the discovery of huge off@@ shore gas reserves and coal deposits in the nor@@ th@@ west could bring in more than $ 5@@ 0@@ b@@ n of investment over the next few next years from companies including Ri@@ o T@@ into , V@@ ale of Brazil , En@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko of the US .
The ruling F@@ reli@@ m@@ o party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the tension .
Ren@@ am@@ o says the government initiated the latest cl@@ ashes by launching an attack on its members in Sof@@ ala province , traditionally a Ren@@ am@@ o str@@ on@@ gh@@ old , on October 17 .
As@@ sa@@ ults on the former reb@@ els then es@@ cal@@ ated as government forces attacked Ren@@ am@@ o bases and attempted to kill Af@@ on@@ so Dh@@ lak@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , Fer@@ n@@ and@@ o Ma@@ z@@ anga , Ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s spo@@ k@@ esman , told the Financial Times .
The government bl@@ ames Ren@@ am@@ o for tri@@ gg@@ ering the cl@@ ashes , acc@@ using it of attac@@ king soldiers .
President Ar@@ mand@@ o Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about inst@@ ability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told A@@ F@@ P , the French news agency , on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day that Mr Dh@@ lak@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; los@@ er &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
Both F@@ reli@@ m@@ o and Ren@@ am@@ o ins@@ ist they want to avoid war .
But concerns have grown after Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga was quoted as saying Ren@@ am@@ o was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace accord .
He told the F@@ T that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by F@@ reli@@ m@@ o .
&quot; Our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with ser@@ i@@ ousness , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga said .
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fu@@ elled by a series of cl@@ ashes this year .
&quot; It &apos;s two big men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and Dh@@ lak@@ ama ) but@@ ting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Han@@ l@@ on , a lec@@ turer at the Open University and Moz@@ ambi@@ que expert .
Neither of them are good negoti@@ ators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
Ren@@ am@@ o , which has been p@@ ushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycot@@ t municipal elections due in November .
Presid@@ ential and parliamentary pol@@ ls are scheduled for next year .
Some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
Ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s share of the vote has been dec@@ lining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former Ren@@ am@@ o member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga says Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; He does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presid@@ ency , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga said .
It is un@@ clear how much capacity Ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has carried out disrup@@ tive h@@ it@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key nor@@ th-@@ south high@@ way .
Most of the sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ishes have taken place in Sof@@ ala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but hosts Be@@ ira , the port that min@@ ers , including Ri@@ o T@@ into and V@@ ale , rely on to export coal .
In June , Ri@@ o suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Ren@@ am@@ o threatened to attack the line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga was co@@ y when asked about whether Ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
Ren@@ am@@ o wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in Moz@@ ambi@@ que , &quot; Mr Ma@@ z@@ anga said .
The inst@@ ability has added to fru@@ stra@@ tions with the government , says Fer@@ n@@ and@@ o Lim@@ a , head of Me@@ di@@ ac@@ oo@@ p , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
O@@ mar Sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demon@@ str@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; No one ca@@ res about Ren@@ am@@ o and F@@ reli@@ m@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
Children should be taught my@@ ths and legends as &quot; models for a way of life &quot; , author says .
T@@ ales of Th@@ or could show &quot; br@@ ute strength is no match for subtle tr@@ ick@@ ery , &quot; while the Arth@@ ur@@ ian legends reveal the importance of having a dream .
Saying many of the my@@ ths would be &quot; far too wild , far too sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; C@@ ros@@ sle@@ y-@@ Hol@@ land advoc@@ ated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of ag@@ e-@@ appropriate works .
&quot; I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ th and fol@@ kl@@ ore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
I have been advoc@@ ating it as a plan for twenty years .
He added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &quot; is a &quot; total swit@@ ch@@ -@@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; sub@@ limin@@ ated &quot; in enjo@@ y@@ able stories .
C@@ ros@@ sle@@ y-@@ Hol@@ land , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ulf from An@@ glo@@ -@@ Sa@@ x@@ on as well as writing the Pen@@ gu@@ in Book of Nor@@ se My@@ ths and British Fol@@ k T@@ ales , said : &quot; You may well have inten@@ tions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
Not that everything has to be simpl@@ ified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an inn@@ ate sense of good and evil .
And that must be sub@@ limin@@ ated ; revealed through a story rather than stated .
The old basis of showing not telling .

B@@ en Gre@@ en@@ man : The T@@ enth Anniversary of the New York Com@@ edy Festival : The New Yor@@ ker
One could argue that New York City is the bir@@ th@@ place of stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ aud@@ ev@@ illi@@ an F@@ rank F@@ ay , who served as the master of ceremon@@ ies at the Palace The@@ atre , on Broad@@ way , started telling jo@@ kes directly to the crowd , in a conver@@ sa@@ tional manner .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Com@@ edy Festival .
Cre@@ ated and over@@ seen by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ s@@ ch , the founder of the stan@@ du@@ p institution Car@@ ol@@ ines , the festival celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large the@@ at@@ res .
&quot; Most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at Car@@ ol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;@@ re too big to play a club , &quot; H@@ ir@@ s@@ ch said .
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
This year &apos;s event includes appe@@ ar@@ ances by W@@ anda Sy@@ kes , K@@ athy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in , and Bill Ma@@ her , as well as &quot; St@@ and Up for Her@@ oes , &quot; an annual mus@@ ic@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ com@@ edy benefit for military veter@@ ans , at Mad@@ ison Squ@@ are Garden , fe@@ at@@ uring , among others , B@@ ru@@ ce Spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , R@@ og@@ er W@@ aters , and Bill C@@ os@@ by .
As the festival has expanded , so has the world of com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ e@@ dians participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Com@@ edy Central , F@@ X , and Spi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ roll rose to promin@@ ence on a deep@@ -@@ cable sit@@ com ( F@@ X@@ X &apos;s gle@@ efully ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y f@@ ant@@ as@@ y-@@ foot@@ ball@@ -@@ them@@ ed &quot; The League &quot; ) and now has his own Com@@ edy Central sket@@ ch show .
J@@ enn@@ y S@@ late has been a cast member on both &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation , &quot; though she is best known for her vir@@ al video series &quot; Mar@@ c@@ el the Sh@@ ell with Sh@@ oes On . &quot;
Both K@@ roll and S@@ late , as well as other young com@@ e@@ dians with distinctive voices ( the sur@@ really p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic An@@ th@@ ony Jes@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the wr@@ y , r@@ aci@@ ally foc@@ us@@ sed W. Kam@@ au B@@ ell ) , are products of the dec@@ entr@@ alized world of American com@@ edy .
One of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg talking to Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stan@@ du@@ p com@@ e@@ dian but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an uno@@ ffic@@ ial com@@ edy histor@@ ian .
From 2005 to 2007 , he ho@@ sted a show on TV Land called &quot; S@@ it Down Com@@ edy with David Ste@@ in@@ berg . &quot;
The meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&quot; The city is definitely in the com@@ edy DNA of all of Lar@@ ry &apos;s work , &quot; Ste@@ in@@ berg said .
He was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;@@ ll walk down an al@@ ley between two buildings and think to himself , H@@ ey , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;@@ ll live here .
Oil extends drop toward $ 96 a bar@@ rel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China &apos;s power@@ -@@ hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening .
Ben@@ ch@@ mark U@@ .@@ S. crude for December delivery was down 14 c@@ ents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ rel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Exchange .
The contract fell 39 c@@ ents on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , leaving it down 5.@@ 8 percent for the month of October .
Am@@ ple supplies of crude have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
The Energy Department said W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day that U@@ .@@ S. supplies increased 4.1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have ris@@ en by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tic@@ k in activity .
That suggests China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth reb@@ ounded to 7.@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a tw@@ o-@@ decade low in the previous quarter .
B@@ rent crude , a ben@@ ch@@ mark for international crude also used by U@@ .@@ S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 c@@ ents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the ICE exchange in London .
Court blocks ruling on N@@ Y@@ P@@ D stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k policy
A federal appeals court on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day blocked a judge &apos;s order requ@@ iring changes to the New York Police Department &apos;s stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
The 2nd U@@ .@@ S. Cir@@ cu@@ it Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Sh@@ ira Sch@@ e@@ ind@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
The judge had ruled in August the city viol@@ ated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stop@@ ping and ques@@ tioning people .
The city appealed her findings and her remedi@@ al orders , including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
The appeals court heard arguments Tu@@ es@@ day on the requested stay .
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ oul of the code of conduct for U@@ .@@ S. judges by com@@ promising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media inter@@ views and public statements respon@@ ding publicly to criticism of the court .
The judge had ruled that police officers viol@@ ated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrong@@ ly targ@@ eting black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men with its stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k program .
She appointed an outside monitor to over@@ see major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test bo@@ dy@@ -@@ worn cam@@ er@@ as in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most st@@ ops occur .
In August , New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop .
An oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14 , 2014 .
The stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tic has been cri@@ tici@@ zed by a number of civil rights advoc@@ ates .
St@@ op@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded st@@ ops increased dram@@ atically under the administration of independent May@@ or Michael B@@ lo@@ om@@ berg to an all@@ -@@ time high in 2011 of 6@@ 8@@ 4,@@ 3@@ 30 , mostly of black and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men .
A law@@ suit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
Sup@@ porters of changes to the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D &apos;s stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will m@@ old a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
Op@@ pon@@ ents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime , waste money and not solve a bro@@ ader problem of a police force under pressure after shr@@ inking by thousands of officers during the last decade .
The judge noted she wasn &apos;@@ t putting an end to the stop@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ fr@@ is@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was re@@ forming the way the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its st@@ ops .
Hu@@ ge numbers of participants from Go@@ dd@@ a , Pak@@ u@@ f , Jam@@ sh@@ ed@@ pur , Dhan@@ bad , Haz@@ ari@@ bag@@ h and Chat@@ ara districts took part in the training .
All the participants were trained in many disciplines over a period of seven days , including pit@@ ching t@@ ents and er@@ ecting flag pol@@ es .
Training is being provided with the co-operation of Dr. Ash@@ ut@@ osh Kumar Roy and I@@ sha Ghosh .
All the particip@@ ant helped to spread a sense of unity by taking part in non@@ denomin@@ ational prayer sessions .
The C@@ amp Chief and Commissioner of State Training , V@@ ip@@ in Kumar , is offering special assistance .
C@@ oul@@ son used phone ha@@ c@@ king to verify tip
For@@ mer News of the World editor An@@ dy C@@ oul@@ son alleg@@ edly used &quot; phone ha@@ c@@ king , sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance and confron@@ tation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bo@@ gus tip about an affair involving th@@ en@@ -@@ home secretary Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or An@@ drew Ed@@ is Q@@ C told the Old B@@ ail@@ ey that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke was seeing his &quot; attractive special advis@@ er , &quot; H@@ ann@@ ah P@@ aw@@ l@@ by .
The newspaper t@@ asked private investig@@ ator Gl@@ en@@ n Mul@@ ca@@ ire with ha@@ c@@ king P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ emails and &quot; door@@ -@@ step@@ ped &quot; her , but C@@ oul@@ son also called and left her vo@@ ic@@ emails , the court heard .
&quot; The prosecution suggests that Mr C@@ oul@@ son , who is now the editor of the Not@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hop@@ ing to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Ed@@ is said .
He said the Not@@ W used three ways to investi@@ gate stories : phone ha@@ c@@ king , sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , and confron@@ tation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
Ob@@ viously he knows about the second , sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance , he must do .
What about the first ?
Does he know about phone ha@@ c@@ king ?
He says he doesn &apos;@@ t , we say &quot; Oh yes , he did &quot; .
R@@ um@@ ours about an affair involving C@@ lar@@ ke were first picked up by the Not@@ W &apos;s features des@@ k when a source who was sex@@ ually interested in Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; Don &apos;@@ t b@@ other w@@ asting your time , she &apos;s with Charles . &quot;
A tape of vo@@ ic@@ emails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mul@@ ca@@ ire &apos;s home in August 2006 .
Investi@@ g@@ ators also found entries on the private investig@@ ator &apos;s computer which had Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by and her sister as &quot; Projects . &quot;
During the period she was being investi@@ gated , Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Ed@@ is said .
Meanwhile , former chief re@@ porter N@@ evil@@ le Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and former re@@ porter James We@@ ath@@ er@@ up over@@ saw sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance of Ms P@@ aw@@ l@@ by &apos;s movements .
Le@@ aving her a vo@@ ic@@ email on June 18 2005 , C@@ oul@@ son told her : &quot; I &apos;@@ ve got a story that we &apos;@@ re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;
Mr Ed@@ is said C@@ oul@@ son &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secretary David Bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
The jury heard on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that C@@ oul@@ son confron@@ ted Mr Bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-@@ defendant Re@@ be@@ kah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was married at the time .
C@@ oul@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny conspir@@ ing with others to ha@@ ck ph@@ ones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 .
Mul@@ ca@@ ire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ ath@@ er@@ up have admitted phone ha@@ c@@ king .
N@@ SA revelations boost corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia about state sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance
On a mil@@ d day in late August a German police hel@@ icop@@ ter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , the financial capital of Germany .
On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , Germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the ro@@ of@@ top of the US out@@ post , which is located less than 5@@ km from the European Central Bank and B@@ un@@ des@@ bank .
German media say the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening anten@@ n@@ as and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Ber@@ lin .
James Cl@@ ap@@ per , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to ste@@ al the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
But ever since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the contrac@@ tor turned wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , began releas@@ ing his treasure tro@@ ve of US sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
Re@@ ports that the US National Security Agency sp@@ ied on Bra@@ z@@ il@@ ian oil company Pet@@ ro@@ br@@ as and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have rat@@ ch@@ eted corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia about state sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance to new high@@ s .
The final stra@@ w came when it was revealed that Chancell@@ or Ang@@ ela Mer@@ k@@ el &apos;s phone had been bu@@ g@@ ged , possibly for about a decade .
If Europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targ@@ eted , then surely business leaders are also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it &apos;s conc@@ ei@@ vable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; Germany must wake up , &quot; says O@@ liver Gr@@ ü@@ n , president of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in July by E@@ Y , the consultancy .
In all the documentation le@@ aked by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secrets to its own companies .
Pol@@ itici@@ ans have expressed concern that the E@@ U lac@@ ks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US .
Business leaders are sc@@ ep@@ tical about this .
Some@@ one in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; That &apos;s not the way , &quot; Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of German business software company SA@@ P , says .
If one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one sh@@ ouldn &apos;@@ t have let it die out 20 years ago .
Everything is subsi@@ dis@@ ed in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ y agencies exposed by the S@@ now@@ den revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance risk was posed by China .
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European exec@@ u@@ tives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore pot@@ entially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the Cl@@ oud Security Alli@@ ance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non-@@ US members cancelled plans to use a US@@ -@@ based cloud provider after revelations about the US Pr@@ ism data mining programme .
J@@ im Sn@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ chief executive at SA@@ P , says : &quot; We see a new question from customers that didn &apos;@@ t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it st@@ ays physically in that jurisdiction . &quot;
Many German exec@@ u@@ tives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs .
That economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
It has always taken place .
&quot; This has been a topic for many years and has@@ n &apos;@@ t fundam@@ entally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says Kur@@ t B@@ ock , chief executive of chemical maker B@@ AS@@ F .
The Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an att@@ ack@@ er .
For large companies , the message has long since been dr@@ um@@ med home that pic@@ king up a free US@@ B stick at a trade fair , or leaving a lap@@ top un@@ guarded in a hotel room are un@@ wise , to say the least .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ack@@ en@@ berg , board member at car@@ maker A@@ udi , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile ph@@ ones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany &apos;s B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es exec@@ u@@ tives to consider using simple pre@@ paid mobil@@ es when on foreign tri@@ ps because of the risk that smart ph@@ ones are com@@ promised .
The pre@@ paid mobil@@ es are then thrown away afterwards .
However , there is concern that small and medi@@ um@@ -@@ sized companies remain vulnerable to ha@@ c@@ king and sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
In Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&quot; Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against un@@ authorised access , &quot; the B@@ f@@ V war@@ ns in a report .
The US war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pion@@ age by other countries .
The US National Intelligence Esti@@ mate in February named France along@@ side Russia and Israel in a second tier of off@@ enders who engage in ha@@ c@@ king for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
A board member at a German bl@@ u@@ e-@@ chi@@ p company con@@ cur@@ red that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst . &quot;
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ C@@ RI , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co-@@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
The Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .

The parents of a Geor@@ gia te@@ en@@ ager , whose body was found inside a rol@@ led@@ -@@ up w@@ rest@@ ling mat in his high school gy@@ m , believe their son was mur@@ dered , the family &apos;s att@@ or@@ ney said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
K@@ end@@ ric@@ k Joh@@ n@@ son , of Val@@ do@@ sta , G@@ a . , was found Jan@@ . 11 stuck in an upright mat pro@@ pped behind the ble@@ ach@@ ers inside his high school gy@@ m .
L@@ own@@ des County sh@@ er@@ if@@ f &apos;s investig@@ ators concluded Joh@@ n@@ son died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; They absolutely think their son was mur@@ dered , &quot; Ben@@ j@@ amin Cr@@ ump , an att@@ or@@ ney representing K@@ enn@@ eth and J@@ acqu@@ el@@ y@@ n Joh@@ n@@ son , told F@@ ox@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com .
They never believed he died the way the sh@@ er@@ if@@ f concluded .
&quot; They believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physics as well as common sense , &quot; Cr@@ ump said .
They think this is a cover@@ -@@ up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; They sent their son to school with a book@@ -@@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
U@@ .@@ S. At@@ tor@@ ney Michael Mo@@ ore said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day he is conducting a formal investigation into Joh@@ n@@ son &apos;s death , no@@ ting that several key questions remain un@@ answered .
What was the cause of death ?
Was his death the result of a crime ?
Mo@@ ore said at a press conference Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
My objective is to discovery the truth .
&quot; I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists &quot; for a formal investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told re@@ porters that the initial aut@@ op@@ sy indicated Joh@@ n@@ son died as a result of &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . &quot;
A second aut@@ op@@ sy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&quot; There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , &quot; he said .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son he will ask the F@@ BI to conduct it .
A representative from the L@@ own@@ des County Sh@@ er@@ if@@ f &apos;s Office was not immediately available for comment when cont@@ acted Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
A southern Geor@@ gia judge on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day ordered authorities to release all sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance video that investig@@ ators reviewed .
The te@@ en@@ ager &apos;s parents said they hope the video foot@@ age will contain clu@@ es to how he died .
C@@ DC issues children &apos;s all@@ ergy guidelines for schools
On W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , the Cent@@ ers for Dis@@ ease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food all@@ er@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of such guidelines the U@@ .@@ S. government has put out , as the number of school@@ -@@ age children suffering from food all@@ er@@ gies clim@@ bs .
One in 20 children in the United States now have food all@@ er@@ gies .
The C@@ DC found the pre@@ val@@ ence of food all@@ er@@ gies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children &apos;s food all@@ er@@ gies , and how to handle them should an all@@ er@@ gic reaction occur .
It also recomm@@ ends schools have ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine stoc@@ ked -@@ - the Epi@@ P@@ en brand aut@@ o-@@ inj@@ ector being most commonly used -@@ - to respond to pot@@ entially fatal an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ x@@ is .
State leg@@ islatures have recently been up@@ dating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine more easily .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms commun@@ icated by children who are having an all@@ er@@ gic reaction .

Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambi@@ gu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ alia .
No longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rig@@ idly assigned to male or female .
The new law doesn &apos;@@ t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certificates .
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hast@@ y decisions on sex@@ -@@ assignment surgery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
One inter@@ sex person , according to the BBC , said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , br@@ u@@ ised and scar@@ red .
An estimated one in 2,@@ 000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
They are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development , an umbrel@@ la term for those with at@@ yp@@ ical chromosomes , gon@@ ads ( ov@@ aries or test@@ es ) , or un@@ usually developed gen@@ it@@ alia .
W@@ all@@ is S@@ imp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex .
G@@ ender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
New York City p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist Dr. J@@ ack D@@ res@@ cher , who speci@@ al@@ izes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
Inter@@ sex children pose ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
&quot; Some people have life@@ -@@ end@@ ang@@ ering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
You can make a gender assignment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens .
It &apos;s like the mystery of why people are g@@ ay .
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological mak@@ e@@ up , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as muscle mass , hair distribution , breasts and st@@ ature ; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and gen@@ it@@ alia ; or in chromos@@ om@@ al structures and hor@@ mon@@ es .
The report also gives an over@@ view of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the realm of employment , as well as levels of har@@ assment , violence and bi@@ as crimes .
G@@ ender non@@ con@@ forming boys now have special camp .
Al@@ ready , Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
In June , a 5@@ 2@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old Australian , Nor@@ ri@@ e May@@ -@@ Wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; g@@ end@@ er@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
German pas@@ sports will have a third design@@ ation other than M or F -@@ - X , for inter@@ sex , according to the Inter@@ ior Ministry .
In neigh@@ bor@@ ing France , gender issues are still contro@@ versi@@ al , according to a news report on France 24 .
In 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of French law@@ makers from that strongly Cath@@ olic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be withdrawn from school text@@ books .
The U@@ .@@ S. website Cath@@ olic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; as the world is being dragged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pillars of civilization . &quot;
One Mar@@ y@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the Bab@@ y Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; Par@@ enting is st@@ res@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;@@ t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the par@@ enting website .
Children need stability and certainty .
Hist@@ or@@ ically , children born with both male and female gen@@ it@@ alia were called her@@ m@@ aph@@ ro@@ d@@ ites , named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sex@@ uality .
And as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a sl@@ ate that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn .
But now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up .
&quot; Back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , &apos; &quot; said D@@ res@@ cher .
When these kids were born , you didn &apos;@@ t call the p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ r@@ ist , you called a sur@@ geon .
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambi@@ gu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ alia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Joh@@ ns Hop@@ k@@ ins University , who held that gender was mal@@ le@@ able .
He co@@ ined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cu@@ es -@@ - how parents raised a child -@@ - inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s genes and hor@@ mon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
But in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Jo@@ an , &quot; his theories became contro@@ versi@@ al .
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been sever@@ ed in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to have the child fully ca@@ strated , removing his testi@@ cles , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; Money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said D@@ res@@ cher .
When the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
But at 38 , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ cher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model . &quot;
But in the 199@@ 0s , with the advent of the Internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender sur@@ g@@ eries have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
Such was the case with J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old writer from Mon@@ t@@ ana , who was born with X@@ Y male chromosomes but ambi@@ gu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als .
Doc@@ tors couldn &apos;@@ t be sure if he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
So shor@@ tly after his birth in 1976 , B@@ ru@@ ce &apos;s external organ and test@@ es were sur@@ g@@ ically removed and he was raised as a girl .
He was given female hor@@ mon@@ es at age 12 .
&quot; I knew that I wasn &apos;@@ t a girl , &quot; he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com .
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he was set for a vag@@ in@@ o@@ pl@@ asty .
But de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
What he found out was horri@@ fying .
I was ster@@ il@@ ized at birth -@@ - and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a D@@ SD that prevented his body from producing enough test@@ ost@@ er@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als .
After learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking test@@ ost@@ er@@ one sh@@ ots and having his breasts removed .
Sur@@ gery rendered him infer@@ tile .
Today , he advoc@@ ates for others in an organization called the Interface Project , trying to nor@@ mal@@ ize percep@@ tions of those who are inter@@ sex .
But Ann@@ e Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ Mat@@ tis , executive director for Cali@@ for@@ ni@@ a-@@ based legal group Advoc@@ ates for In@@ formed Cho@@ ice , wor@@ ries that the German law &quot; inv@@ ites lab@@ eling and sti@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; A lot of ac@@ tivi@@ sts are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined , &apos; &quot; she said .
We are afraid it will encourage intervention .
We think a better process is as@@ signing male or female sex , then waiting .
But we haven &apos;@@ t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is spec@@ ulate .
Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; Ad@@ ults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
German law is about as@@ signing it at birth .
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
When they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr. Ar@@ l@@ ene Bar@@ at@@ z , a P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will &quot; em@@ power &quot; both parents and children .
Bar@@ at@@ z &apos;s daughter K@@ ati@@ e was born with male chromosomes , but has a D@@ SD called complete and@@ rogen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
Because her and@@ rogen recep@@ tors are fa@@ ulty , K@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
She has a vagina , but no uterus or ov@@ aries .
Now at 29 , K@@ ati@@ e is married and at the University of Pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , a resident in child p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry .
Though she is infer@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational sur@@ rog@@ acy .
&quot; The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves , &quot; said Bar@@ at@@ z .
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos; 
This way , you are OK -@@ - raise the child , love the child .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
We don &apos;@@ t have to rush into surgery that is ir@@ rever@@ sible .
&quot; It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;@@ t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
Ul@@ timately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -@@ - and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
It em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .

In this camp awareness was raised about the right to education and information for fin@@ anci@@ ally under@@ privileged people .

Report : Obama campaign considered dum@@ ping B@@ id@@ en for H@@ illary Cl@@ int@@ on
President Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s clos@@ est advis@@ ers secretly considered re@@ placing Vice President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en with H@@ illary Cl@@ int@@ on on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
The revelation is the most notable bomb@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ eman@@ n &apos;s heavily anticip@@ ated 2012 campaign t@@ ome , &quot; Double Down : Game Change 2012 . &quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the forth@@ coming book and reported Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day evening that the President &apos;s top a@@ ides conducted &quot; extensive grou@@ p@@ -@@ sessions and pol@@ ling in late 2011 &quot; to gau@@ ge whether the dum@@ ping B@@ id@@ en could help bol@@ ster Obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re-@@ election hopes .
According to the Times &apos; national political cor@@ respondent Jon@@ a@@ than Martin , the book provides a thor@@ ough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ apping former Secretary of State Cl@@ int@@ on for the Vice President would have in the pol@@ ls .
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Ch@@ ic@@ ago campaign infrastructure and inside the O@@ val Office .
Only half a dozen of the President &apos;s clos@@ est advis@@ ers -@@ - including Dal@@ ey , former Obama campaign chief J@@ im Mess@@ ina , and former White House senior advis@@ ers David A@@ x@@ el@@ rod and David Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e -@@ - knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; Double Down &quot; claims Dal@@ ey spe@@ ar@@ headed the effort to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their &quot; close personal rap@@ port , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Cl@@ int@@ on to the ticket wouldn &apos;@@ t &quot; mater@@ ially improve Obama &apos;s od@@ ds . &quot;
In an interview with Martin , Dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider re@@ placing B@@ id@@ en with Cl@@ int@@ on .
&quot; I was voc@@ al about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Dal@@ ey told the paper .
You have to remember , at that point the President was in awful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;
While Dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due dil@@ ig@@ ence , &quot; Martin told C@@ N@@ N &apos;s An@@ der@@ son Co@@ op@@ er that the re-@@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay divid@@ ends at the pol@@ ls .
&quot; Cam@@ pa@@ igns don &apos;@@ t spend the kind of money on pol@@ ling and focus groups unless they &apos;@@ re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
It &apos;s un@@ clear , however , whether Obama knew his team was expl@@ oring the s@@ wa@@ p .
Martin told C@@ N@@ N that he asked Dal@@ ey whether his th@@ en@@ -@@ b@@ oss knew about the potential sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le .
While Dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;@@ t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; Double Down &quot; does not defin@@ i@@ tively answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached Obama &apos;s des@@ k .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dum@@ ping B@@ id@@ en from the ticket .
&quot; Pos@@ sibly , &quot; Martin replied .
F@@ ancy a g@@ low@@ -@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ dark ice cre@@ am ?
A British entre@@ preneur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low@@ -@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ dark ice cre@@ am - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has har@@ n@@ essed the flu@@ ores@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the l@@ umin@@ es@@ cent sn@@ ack .
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically rec@@ re@@ ate the g@@ lowing protein .
The ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the e@@ ater &apos;s tongue - raising the p@@ H level in the protein and making it g@@ low .
Chr@@ is says because the ice cre@@ am lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you l@@ ick , the brigh@@ ter it becomes .
Char@@ lie , founder of the &quot; L@@ ick Me I &apos;@@ m Del@@ ic@@ ious &quot; ice cre@@ am company , said : &quot; It is incre@@ dible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
The protein we are using in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with your tongue at neutr@@ al p@@ H .
So as your mouth war@@ ms up the protein it will raise the p@@ H level and the ice cre@@ am will g@@ low .
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Hal@@ lo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am I have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish l@@ umin@@ escence is four times more expensive than gold .
So each sc@@ oo@@ p costs me around £ 14@@ 0 .
It t@@ astes pretty good though .
Char@@ lie &apos;s experimental company , based in Bri@@ st@@ ol , is fam@@ ed for its unusual flav@@ ours including be@@ er , che@@ ese , be@@ ef and gold leaf .
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
He said : &quot; I really want to develop an invisible ice cre@@ am . &quot;
It is inher@@ ently impossible because of the re@@ fraction caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cre@@ am , but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it .
The ice cre@@ am har@@ nesses the flu@@ ores@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , syn@@ the@@ sized by Chinese scientists
Rani Bag@@ h Market was pac@@ ked with customers .
The situation was such that people had to wait from 15 to 20 minutes to buy uten@@ sil@@ s .
The same was the case in Vaj@@ ir@@ pur , Av@@ anti@@ ka market , Ro@@ h@@ ini , Na@@ har@@ pur , Ash@@ ok Vi@@ har , the Central Market , and the central market in Pr@@ ash@@ ant Vi@@ har .
There was a similar scene in the jewellery shops in P@@ it@@ amp@@ ura , Ash@@ ok Vi@@ har , and Model Town .
Many people were shopping for gold and silver ornaments and coins .
Because of this , the outer ring road , along with other markets , were j@@ amm@@ ed with traffic .
Because of this people leaving the office had to spend hours in traffic j@@ ams on their way home .
Hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : By the Num@@ bers
When I was little , Hal@@ lo@@ ween was mag@@ ical .
My sister and I were allowed to eat cand@@ y , stay up late and play dres@@ s-@@ up for the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
N@@ ow@@ adays , I &apos;@@ ve become more of a scro@@ o@@ ge .
I haven &apos;@@ t signed up for the past two years to give out cand@@ y in my apar@@ tment and probably won &apos;@@ t this year .
But stat@@ s show that I &apos;@@ m a black sheep when it comes to Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celebr@@ ating Hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on cand@@ y , co@@ st@@ umes and decor@@ ations , according to the National Ret@@ ail Federation .
One thing I do look forward to every Hal@@ lo@@ ween are the trends .
Co@@ st@@ umes are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the NR@@ F .
This year , sex@@ y in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the rage .
Women don &apos;@@ t have to be sex@@ y professionals any@@ more ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like p@@ iz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ omb@@ ies , thanks to The Wal@@ king De@@ ad and I &apos;@@ ll bet the D@@ af@@ t Pun@@ k space men will make it into our Inst@@ agram feeds this year .
According to Google , the highest sear@@ ched co@@ st@@ umes are z@@ omb@@ ies , Bat@@ man , p@@ ir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I guess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
We dressed our do@@ gs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 million on pet co@@ st@@ umes this year , according to the NR@@ F .
That &apos;s a lot of ir@@ onic hot@@ dog do@@ gs .
When it comes to cand@@ y , we don &apos;@@ t scre@@ w around .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion on it this year , according to The Ni@@ el@@ sen Company .
That &apos;s around 600 million p@@ ounds worth of Her@@ sh@@ ey bars , l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop@@ s , Milk Du@@ ds , Tw@@ iz@@ z@@ lers and C@@ lar@@ k B@@ ars .
That &apos;s great news for the 41 million tr@@ ick@@ -@@ or@@ -@@ treat@@ ers set to take over our neigh@@ bor@@ hoods , according to the U@@ .@@ S. Commerce Department .
In fact , we will buy and , who are we kid@@ ding , consume 90 million p@@ ounds of ch@@ oc@@ olate during Hal@@ lo@@ ween .
The one thing we don &apos;@@ t want to consume , cand@@ y corn ; and yet nearly 35 million p@@ ounds of it are sold around Hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the National Con@@ f@@ ec@@ tioners Association .
That &apos;s about 9 billion individual ker@@ n@@ els of corn .
It &apos;s a mystery I have yet to solve .
Nothing is more qu@@ int@@ essentially Hal@@ lo@@ ween than ha@@ un@@ ted houses .
They have the best names , like &quot; T@@ error Be@@ hind the W@@ alls &quot; ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; H@@ ow@@ l@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ Scre@@ am &quot; and &quot; The House of Sh@@ ock . &quot;
In fact , there are 1,@@ 200 offic@@ ially sanctioned ha@@ un@@ ted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes those aw@@ esome photos of you mid@@ -@@ pe@@ eing your p@@ ants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can &apos;@@ t take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;
Finally , let &apos;s talk p@@ ump@@ k@@ ins .
Char@@ lie B@@ rown introduced us to The Great P@@ ump@@ kin when we were kids , and car@@ ving a jack@@ -@@ o-@@ lan@@ tern is like decor@@ ating a Christ@@ mas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;@@ ve done since we were little .
Luc@@ ky for us , the &quot; baby in a p@@ ump@@ kin trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ interest , so most of us grew up car@@ ving these g@@ our@@ ds not sitting in them .
This year , Americans will spend around $ 10@@ 6 million on p@@ ump@@ k@@ ins , according to the U@@ .@@ S. C@@ ensus Bureau .
The jack@@ -@@ o-@@ lan@@ tern slowly with@@ ering on your front por@@ ch probably came from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , which grew 5@@ 42 million p@@ ounds of p@@ ump@@ kin this year .
If you &apos;@@ re looking for extra credit , call T@@ im and Sus@@ an Math@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , Cal@@ if . , and try to car@@ ve up their 2,@@ 0@@ 32 pound p@@ ump@@ kin .
The M@@ CA said in a statement , &quot; It was decided that the po@@ stage stamp with Sach@@ in &apos;s photograph on it would be issued prior to the start of the match .
Af@@ ter@@ wards , there would be a joint presentation by the B@@ C@@ CI and the M@@ CA .
Besides that , a special coin would be used for the coin t@@ oss that would be kept by the M@@ CA .
The M@@ CA will also publish a 6@@ 4-@@ page bro@@ ch@@ ure , which will have articles about Tend@@ ulkar and testi@@ mon@@ ies about him from the business , spor@@ ting and journ@@ alist around the world .
The association said the limited edition bro@@ ch@@ ures and coins will be distributed to members of the M@@ CA and the B@@ C@@ CI .
They said that every day 10@@ ,@@ 000 m@@ asks , 10@@ ,@@ 000 score cards and 10@@ ,@@ 000 cap@@ s bearing Sach@@ in &apos;s photograph will be distributed .

The dream of fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders of doing good business in the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market in the transport area was not realised .
The fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders are tr@@ apped in a dil@@ em@@ ma after the High court &apos;s order .
Neither can they do business in the temporary fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market in Ran@@ jit A@@ ven@@ ue , nor have they been issued lic@@ enses to do business in the Transport area .
After its visit to the temporary fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market in Ran@@ jit A@@ ven@@ ue the commission , appointed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court , had declared it un@@ safe .
Since no appropriate arrangements were made there , the Deputy commission@@ er was fined ten lakh Rupe@@ es .
The High Court strongly critic@@ ised the Amritsar administration in its order and questioned the use of such an administration that could not even resolve such a small issue as that of the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders over a period of the 9 years .
No proper place has been allotted to them in the city .
Thereafter , they were asked to provide appropriate and safe facilities and to issue the lic@@ enses for selling fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ ers in Ja@@ ha@@ j@@ garh market itself .
After this order the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders were happy but the police poured cold water on their joy on Friday .
The fire@@ arm license branch team arrived in the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market and set up a counter selling forms .
The necessary terms and conditions involved , could not possibly be met in one day .
AS@@ P East G@@ aur@@ av Gar@@ g , Fire@@ arms License Branch chief , An@@ up Kumar , SH@@ O Sul@@ tan@@ v@@ ind A@@ run Sharma also went to the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market .
They expressed dis@@ satisfaction over the arrangements made by the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders .
So the lic@@ enses were not issued to the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders .
Diwali is just one day away .
For this reason the fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er v@@ end@@ ors were worried .
The loss of crores of rupees seemed inevitable .
Fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders Av@@ in@@ ash Singh , Rak@@ esh S@@ eth , Har@@ ish Dha@@ wan , Har@@ ish Du@@ a , Des@@ raj , Sat@@ nam Singh , Man@@ jin@@ der Singh and G@@ in@@ ni said that if they lost a large amount of money they would sue the district administration .
On Friday night the angry fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er traders went on a protest march from Ja@@ ha@@ j@@ garh to Ran@@ je@@ et A@@ ven@@ ue .
The sh@@ outed slog@@ ans against the police and the administration .
Thereafter the business in the temporary fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er market at Ran@@ je@@ et A@@ ven@@ ue was also stopped .
Fire cre@@ ws called to rescue lost pup@@ py after she got stuck 5@@ 0@@ ft above the ground on prec@@ ari@@ ous ledge in a quar@@ ry
C@@ oc@@ ker sp@@ aniel Ru@@ by had run off after she was in a minor road crash
She was sp@@ otted three days later by a dog wal@@ ker tr@@ apped in the quar@@ ry
Fire@@ fighters ab@@ se@@ il down cli@@ ff face to pl@@ uck the dog from certain death
A pup@@ py had a lucky escape after fire cre@@ ws were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 5@@ 0@@ ft up on a prec@@ ari@@ ous cli@@ ff ledge .
N@@ ine mon@@ th-@@ old coc@@ ker sp@@ aniel Ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quar@@ ry on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day .
Her owners Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend Bec@@ ky Hall , 20 , were at Fl@@ app@@ it Quar@@ ry in Den@@ hol@@ me , West Yor@@ ksh@@ ire , to be re@@ united with Ru@@ by and have than@@ ked West Yor@@ ksh@@ ire Fire and Res@@ c@@ ue Service .
They had sear@@ ched fr@@ an@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social net@@ working sites after she had ran into the quar@@ ry following the minor accident .
At around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day , an eag@@ le@@ -@@ eyed dog wal@@ ker sp@@ otted Ru@@ by on the ledge in the quar@@ ry , str@@ anded 5@@ 0@@ ft up .
A Technical Res@@ c@@ ue Team from Cl@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on Fire Station rushed to the scene and ab@@ se@@ iled down to rescue Ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the cli@@ ff .
Speci@@ alist Technical Res@@ c@@ ue Officer An@@ dy C@@ lay@@ ton said : &apos; She was in a prec@@ ari@@ ous situation .
She was right in the middle of the cli@@ ff face - 5@@ 0@@ ft from the top and bottom .
She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was fro@@ zen solid .
But she is fine now .
She was eating b@@ is@@ cu@@ its afterwards .
This was a very unusual cal@@ l@@ -@@ out .
The fact that the dog was sp@@ otted is un@@ believ@@ able .
Speci@@ alist Technical Res@@ c@@ ue Officer Pet@@ er La@@ u said : &quot; Ru@@ by had a very lucky escape . &quot;
The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was taken to the v@@ ets for a check@@ -@@ up and was found to be fine other than exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hydr@@ ation .
Mis@@ s Hall , from H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x , West Yor@@ ksh@@ ire , said : &quot; Wat@@ ching the rescue was terri@@ fying . &quot;
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
It was amazing to get her back in our arms .
The v@@ et said that if she became too exhausted and collap@@ sed she would probably have fallen .
The fire@@ fighters were amazing .
It was really dar@@ ing what they did .
We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ eigh@@ ley , added : &quot; We were s@@ cared that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
The fire@@ fighters were brilliant .
I just can &apos;@@ t believe where she was .
M@@ ick Jag@@ ger says he never hit on Kat@@ y Per@@ ry when she was 18 .
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week , the pop star said she sang bac@@ king voc@@ als for Jag@@ ger &apos;s 2004 song &quot; Old H@@ ab@@ its Di@@ e H@@ ard . &quot;
Per@@ ry said she had dinner with the veter@@ an roc@@ ker and that &quot; he hit on me when I was 18 . &quot;
She added , &quot; That was a long time ago , and he &apos;s been very kind . &quot;
In a statement Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , a representative for Jag@@ ger , 70 , says he &quot; categor@@ ically denies that he has ever made a pass at Kat@@ y Per@@ ry . &quot;
The re@@ p adds : &quot; Perhaps she is conf@@ using him with someone else . &quot;

George Ker@@ ev@@ an : Europe break@@ -@@ up gives S@@ co@@ ts choice
Another day , another independence sc@@ are story .
This time we are warned that an independent Scot@@ land would be required to join the Europe@@ -@@ wide free@@ -@@ travel zone as a condition of E@@ U membership .
C@@ ue stories about passport controls at Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wire border along H@@ ad@@ ri@@ an &apos;s W@@ all .
True , the Str@@ ath@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of Europe , though - predic@@ t@@ ably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines .
Nor did anyone point out that the E@@ U member states spend much of their time b@@ ending their formal rules if it su@@ its them .
Since Scot@@ land isn &apos;@@ t in the Sch@@ eng@@ en area now , continued non-@@ compliance would be a cheap concession for Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the S@@ co@@ ts .
So , a non-@@ story , then .
And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fos@@ sil@@ ised : I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this ret@@ elling of a whis@@ k@@ ery old tale .
Why should an independent Scot@@ land be expected to do Europe &apos;s bidding , anyway ?
Why trade London &apos;s yo@@ ke for that of Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s , especially now ?
Here is the real European news : the great , post@@ -@@ war plan to unite Europe has finally st@@ alled .
With the e@@ ur@@ o crisis , Project Europe is offic@@ ially dead .
Ac@@ ross the E@@ U , parties which are dedicated to op@@ posing the E@@ U , or to scr@@ apping the e@@ ur@@ o as a common currency , are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Eu@@ ros@@ cep@@ tic Altern@@ ative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from no@@ where to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in September &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively kno@@ c@@ king the Free Democ@@ r@@ ats ( equivalent to our own Li@@ b D@@ ems ) out of the B@@ un@@ dest@@ ag .
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed .
The au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Ber@@ lin and the European Central Bank , cou@@ pled with the strait@@ jack@@ et imposed on national economies through adher@@ ence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
The crisis of the e@@ ur@@ o has little to do with national governments running excessive budget defic@@ its - that was true only of Gre@@ ece .
Rather , the e@@ ur@@ o system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of domestic currency dev@@ al@@ uation , southern Europe finds itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis Germany .
The only rec@@ our@@ se is to sl@@ ash wages and public spending - spur@@ red on by Ber@@ lin .
B@@ ey@@ ond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity mal@@ a@@ ise .
As a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s - code for subsi@@ dis@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry p@@ ays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
That is a crip@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we &apos;@@ ve already seen at Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
All the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;@@ t stop the European pet@@ ro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mer@@ ed by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , revolt is bre@@ wing , especially in France , once the E@@ U &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader .
After the war , the French political elite saw the E@@ U as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal b@@ illing in the world with Washington .
But Ber@@ lin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legi@@ tim@@ acy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the bat@@ tered French economy strug@@ gling .
Res@@ ult : Mar@@ ine L@@ e P@@ en &apos;s righ@@ t-@@ wing , anti@@ -@@ E@@ U National Fr@@ ont has just won a crucial b@@ y-@@ election , kno@@ c@@ king the ruling Soci@@ alists into third place .
The Fr@@ ont is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can &apos;@@ t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
What is L@@ e P@@ en doing with her new@@ found popularity among the French white , working class ?
She wants to use next year &apos;s E@@ U elections to create an anti@@ -@@ E@@ U , anti@@ -@@ common currency blo@@ c across the European Parliament .
If , as is very possible , anti@@ -@@ E@@ U parties do well in these elections , such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the European Parliament for the first time .
Here &apos;s my point : sometime soon growing anti@@ -@@ E@@ U and anti@@ -@@ common currency feeling in Europe will coal@@ es@@ ce to kill the e@@ ur@@ o .
The E@@ U won &apos;@@ t disappear , but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot; Europe of the ( Sover@@ eign ) Nations &quot; favoured by General de G@@ a@@ ul@@ le .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the e@@ ur@@ o but France and southern Europe will revive their own curr@@ encies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hop@@ ing to cos@@ y up to the US .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
Where does this leave Scot@@ land ?
We can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Ber@@ lin and Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s where to get off .
I susp@@ ect that Scot@@ land could do well inside a loos@@ er European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
Co@@ -@@ operation with other lik@@ e-@@ minded countries will be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe of the Nations .
Otherwise we should consider em@@ ulating Nor@@ way and re@@ taining our economic independence .
The S@@ N@@ P government in Scot@@ land is - remark@@ abl@@ y-@@ - the most successful anti@@ -@@ au@@ ster@@ ity political movement in Europe , having won a spectac@@ ular majority in 2011 on the basis of op@@ posing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour &apos;s ch@@ ancell@@ or A@@ list@@ air Dar@@ ling and the subsequent Tor@@ y-@@ Li@@ b De@@ m coal@@ ition .
It would be ridic@@ ulous now for Scot@@ land to vote for independence only to accept au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Ber@@ lin and Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s .
Early pub@@ er@@ ty : G@@ rowing older sooner
Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts , research shows .
Physical changes don &apos;@@ t mean pub@@ er@@ ty is im@@ minent
There &apos;s no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are to blame
Exper@@ ts think the ob@@ es@@ ity epid@@ emic might be one trigger of early pub@@ er@@ ty
The trend toward early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced with boys
For@@ mer C@@ N@@ N cor@@ respondent P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist speci@@ alizing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
Should a mother be al@@ armed if her daughter begins to spr@@ out breast bu@@ ds and pub@@ ic hair at 7 or 8 ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ rics this week in Or@@ land@@ o , Fl@@ or@@ ida , pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Dr. Paul Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new nor@@ m .
&quot; I spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents -@@ - usually , this does not signal a rapid progres@@ sion into full pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; said Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z .
Ob@@ vious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding breasts , pub@@ ic and under@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appearing sooner in girls .
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of men@@ arch@@ e ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12@@ .5 years , down from 12@@ .@@ 75 in 1970 .
&quot; Once breasts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ arch@@ e , &quot; said Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z , also author of &quot; Early Pub@@ er@@ ty in Gir@@ ls : The Es@@ s@@ ential Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Prob@@ lem . &quot;
Time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty is going to progress .
There is debate about what constitutes the actual on@@ set of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; p@@ reco@@ ci@@ ous &quot; when breast enlar@@ gement is accompanied by a growth spur@@ t before age 8 .
In most cases , the process will slow down or st@@ all -@@ - something a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can monitor closely .
A more rapid progres@@ sion may warrant tests by an en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tum@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
There are treat@@ ments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : pre@@ mature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to st@@ un@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
Recom@@ m@@ end@@ ations for drug or hor@@ m@@ one therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .
P@@ sych@@ os@@ o@@ cial aspects are important , too .
Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z is cautious with med@@ ication but acknowled@@ ges , &quot; sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty may all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate behavi@@ oral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from pe@@ ers . &quot;
The other big issue is under@@ stand@@ able : Par@@ ents simply don &apos;@@ t want their very young daughters having periods .
&quot; They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z .
&quot; It was a shock , &quot; rec@@ alls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstr@@ uation , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She came home from school s@@ cared and upset to be the first among her friends .
There are lots of well-@@ public@@ ized theories about the causes of p@@ reco@@ ci@@ ous pub@@ er@@ ty .
Yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
Bo@@ ys - like girls - are h@@ itting pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z cont@@ ends the prem@@ ise that holds the most weight is the epid@@ emic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6@@ - to 9@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old girls that links body fat to the tim@@ ing of pub@@ er@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
In this country , Afr@@ ic@@ an@@ -@@ American and H@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts .
There are varying ex@@ plan@@ ations .
Glo@@ bally , patterns of early pub@@ er@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
Another con@@ und@@ rum : Although boys are getting fac@@ ial and pub@@ ic hair at younger ages , the trend toward ful@@ l@@ -@@ blown early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .
Other doctors attending the A@@ AP conference rein@@ forced the complex@@ ities of the topic .
The appearance of ac@@ ne and pub@@ ic hair is common even in inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers .
&quot; We need to be careful about how we identify the true on@@ set of pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; said Dr. La@@ wr@@ ence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist at Gor@@ ye@@ b Children &apos;s Hospital in Mor@@ rist@@ own , New Jer@@ sey .
Par@@ ents should not hes@@ itate to get guidance from their pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ian about how to talk with their child .
&quot; It may mean having a so@@ on@@ er@@ -@@ than@@ -@@ expected conversation , &quot; Kap@@ low@@ it@@ z advised .
If you remain calm , your child usually will respond well .
Gir@@ ls who blos@@ som early need re@@ assurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .

J@@ et makers fe@@ ud over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has f@@ la@@ red up between leading plane makers over the width of tou@@ rist@@ -@@ class seats on long-@@ distance f@@ lights , setting the tone for a bitter confron@@ tation at this month &apos;s D@@ ub@@ ai Air@@ show .
The dispute foc@@ uses on the width of seats provided on long-@@ ha@@ ul f@@ lights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by air@@ lines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest j@@ ets offered by Air@@ bus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing Co .
Air@@ bus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its U@@ .@@ S. arch@@ -@@ ri@@ val Bo@@ eing says it should be for air@@ lines to decide .
The dispute comes as plane makers vi@@ e to sell ever@@ -@@ larger versions of their tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ distance aircraft , with pot@@ entially record orders expected at the November 17@@ -@@ 21 event .
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether se@@ ating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; min@@ i@@ -@@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; j@@ et designs .
Bo@@ eing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &quot; will hold 4@@ 06 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Air@@ bus says the comp@@ eting version of its A@@ 3@@ 50 will carry 3@@ 50 people in 18@@ -@@ in@@ ch@@ -@@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast .
Pl@@ ane gi@@ ants often trade blow@@ s on technical matters through advertis@@ ing in the trade press .
Now , Air@@ bus is appe@@ aling directly to the public ahead of the D@@ ub@@ ai Air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
It recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing fin@@ anci@@ ers a sli@@ de illu@@ strating three people squ@@ ashed together at a restaur@@ ant , titled &quot; Would You Accept This ? &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ eing is propos@@ ing long-@@ distance flying in seats nar@@ row@@ er than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said Air@@ bus sales chief John Le@@ a@@ hy .
As di@@ ets change , people get bigger but plane se@@ ating has not rad@@ ically changed .
Between the early 197@@ 0s , when the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 j@@ umb@@ o defined modern long-@@ ha@@ ul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 4@@ 0@@ - to 4@@ 9@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U@@ .@@ S. Health Department Data .
The wa@@ ist of the average 21@@ st@@ -@@ century American male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 in@@ ches , according to U@@ .@@ S. health statistics .
Air@@ bus says its ri@@ val is stic@@ king to a seat concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly ch@@ rist@@ ened &quot; j@@ et set &quot; was nar@@ row@@ er .
Air@@ bus says it has commission@@ ed research sugg@@ esting an extra inch in seat width im@@ proves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Bo@@ eing disputes Air@@ bus &apos;s figures on seat meas@@ u@@ rements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how air@@ lines balance fa@@ res and facilities .
It also says research shows cab@@ in experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; It really comes down to providing flexibility to air@@ lines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Bo@@ eing cab@@ ins expert K@@ ent C@@ ra@@ ver .
They don &apos;@@ t want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them prof@@ itable .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bow room , but for suppl@@ iers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
Be@@ hind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 7@@ 00@@ -@@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of U@@ .@@ S. and European exports .
As Re@@ ut@@ ers first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest j@@ ets .
Both Air@@ bus and Bo@@ eing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ ha@@ ul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 3@@ 6@@ 5@@ -@@ seat Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ -@@ 30@@ 0@@ ER .
Bo@@ eing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on compar@@ ing the 10@@ -@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X with an original 9@@ -@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 77 design .
The gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10@@ -@@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use .
&quot; The reason Bo@@ eing are doing this is to c@@ ram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Air@@ bus .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say full 10@@ -@@ se@@ at@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ row cab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the den@@ ser layout , which may go hand in hand with che@@ aper fa@@ res .
&quot; E@@ igh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Air@@ bus proposal is driven by the threat of the 7@@ 77 , &quot; said cab@@ in inter@@ i@@ ors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the R@@ un@@ way Gir@@ l Network .
Air@@ bus and Bo@@ eing do not supply seats but offer a cat@@ alogue of suppl@@ iers for air@@ lines to choose from .
Glo@@ be@@ -@@ tro@@ t@@ ting j@@ et sel@@ lers even carry tape measures to check on comp@@ eting lay@@ outs .
While bo@@ asting comfort , all buil@@ ders also offer j@@ ets with high@@ -@@ density lay@@ outs for low@@ -@@ cost air@@ lines and regional travel .
Air@@ bus offers a 10@@ -@@ ab@@ re@@ ast A@@ 3@@ 50 but says it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Air@@ bus was st@@ res@@ sing the need for more cab@@ in custom@@ ization by offering wider a@@ is@@ le seats on some of its j@@ ets .
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern j@@ ets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is un@@ likely to fly , but could distr@@ act from a wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales .
New anti@@ -@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti@@ -@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a ci@@ gare@@ t@@ te .
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect m@@ ice against nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for life .
Further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald Cr@@ yst@@ al of We@@ ill Cor@@ n@@ ell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
&quot; We are very hop@@ eful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop , exha@@ ust@@ ing all the methods on the market today , but find their nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Pr@@ of Cor@@ n@@ ell said .
The new vaccine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti@@ -@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus sel@@ ectively inf@@ ects liver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies hun@@ t down any nic@@ ot@@ ine molec@@ ules in the blood@@ stream , neutr@@ al@@ ising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a nic@@ ot@@ ine hit .
In tests , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice who were subsequently given nic@@ ot@@ ine continued with their normal activity .
But m@@ ice who had not been given the vaccine &quot; chil@@ led out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
The experiments are described in the journal Science Trans@@ la@@ tional Medic@@ ine .
Previous tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels top@@ ped up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it turns liver cells into anti@@ body factories .
Pr@@ of Cr@@ yst@@ al said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a ci@@ gare@@ t@@ te , preventing nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction .
But more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to quit .
&quot; They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and that can help them k@@ ick the habit , &quot; he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .
The cause of the death of the ti@@ gress was not clear , even after the post@@ -@@ mor@@ tem .
The forest department , giving an ev@@ asi@@ ve answer , said that pri@@ ma@@ -@@ fac@@ ie , the ti@@ gress seemed to have died a natural death .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night the forest employees of the P@@ aw@@ al@@ garh Conservation reserve of the Ram@@ nagar Forest department found a ti@@ gress &apos;s body near the Kh@@ ic@@ ha@@ di dra@@ in .
The ti@@ gress &apos;s body was int@@ act and no signs of w@@ ounds or injury were found on the body .
On Friday an aut@@ op@@ sy was conducted on the body of the ti@@ gress by CT@@ R veter@@ in@@ arian Bharat and Kot@@ ab@@ ag@@ h veter@@ in@@ arian H@@ ema R@@ ath@@ ore in the presence of the Con@@ serv@@ ator of Fore@@ sts , Vive@@ k Pan@@ de@@ y , the CT@@ R dep@@ uty director , Sak@@ et Bad@@ ola , D@@ F@@ O Ka@@ hak@@ ash@@ a Nas@@ eem , and S@@ DO J@@ .@@ S. Kar@@ k@@ ee .
According to sources , during the aut@@ op@@ sy , the internal organs of the ti@@ gress were reported to be damaged .
Because of this the actual cause of death of the ti@@ gress was not known .
Department officials are giving ev@@ asi@@ ve answers about the death of the ti@@ gress .
However , to test for the presence of poison , the internal organs have been sent to IV@@ RI B@@ are@@ l@@ li for a tox@@ ic@@ ology test .

There were no trac@@ es of poison in the body .
However , a search of the surrounding areas was carried out and the vis@@ cer@@ a were sent to be tested for the presence of poison .
Tri@@ po@@ di denies being influenced by Obe@@ id
For@@ mer N@@ S@@ W Lab@@ or minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investi@@ gated by the state &apos;s corruption watch@@ dog .
For@@ mer N@@ S@@ W minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime leas@@ es policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die Obe@@ id , who had hidden interests in three properties on govern@@ ment@@ -@@ controlled land .
The Independent Commission Ag@@ ainst Cor@@ rup@@ tion ( IC@@ AC ) on Friday wid@@ ened its inquiry into whether Mr Obe@@ id lo@@ b@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have leas@@ es at Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay , where the Obe@@ ids owned two restaur@@ ants and a c@@ af@@ e , renewed without going to tender after their exp@@ iration in August 2005 .
It &apos;s now investig@@ ating allegations Mr Tri@@ po@@ di knew of Mr Obe@@ id &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former dep@@ uty chief of staff , L@@ yn@@ ne Ash@@ pol@@ e , on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been p@@ ushing for the leas@@ es to go to public tender .
The les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
In 2009 leas@@ es for the Cir@@ cular Qu@@ ay enterprises , which earned the Obe@@ ids about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public tend@@ ers .
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obe@@ id , who Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was ur@@ ging a shift in government lease policy .
A phone trans@@ crip@@ t t@@ abled in IC@@ AC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obe@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior bureau@@ cr@@ at who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obe@@ id in the fish@@ eries department .
&quot; Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conver@@ sations the development of the commercial lease policy , &quot; Assistant Commissioner An@@ th@@ ony Whe@@ aly asked Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; No , &quot; Mr Tri@@ po@@ di replied .
I can &apos;@@ t remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn &apos;@@ t that .
De@@ fin@@ itely not between myself and Mr Obe@@ id .
Israeli war@@ planes attack target inside Syri@@ a , official says
Israeli war@@ planes struck a target inside the Syri@@ an port city of Lat@@ ak@@ ia Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day night , a senior administration official con@@ firms to Fo@@ x News .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
The Associ@@ ated Press reports the target was Rus@@ si@@ an@@ -@@ made SA@@ -@@ 125 mis@@ sil@@ es .
At least twice earlier this year Israel launched air@@ strikes on ship@@ ments of mis@@ sil@@ es inside Syri@@ a .
Foreign workers on 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could undergo &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test
A &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 vis@@ as is being considered by the government as it contempl@@ ates expanding a cr@@ ack@@ down .
The test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 4@@ 5@@ 7@@ s being used to fill un@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
A government discussion paper was released today as former Lab@@ or MP Max@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ ew s@@ lam@@ med the government &apos;s rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic about foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; L@@ oud declar@@ ations about &apos; foreign@@ ers getting to the back of the que@@ ue &apos; and &apos; A@@ us@@ si@@ e jobs first &apos; are a very un@@ pleasant th@@ row@@ back to a time when uni@@ ons demanded a protected lab@@ or market , &quot; she told the Australia India Institute today .
Hist@@ or@@ ically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw ech@@ oes of that historic arti@@ fact , I wouldn &apos;@@ t be surprised .
The discussion paper out@@ lines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Imm@@ i@@ gr@@ ation Minister Chr@@ is B@@ ow@@ en .
Imm@@ i@@ gr@@ ation Minister Br@@ end@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ nor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration .
If the &quot; genu@@ in@@ eness &quot; criteria was adopted a vis@@ a applicant could be scrut@@ in@@ ised about &quot; whether the nom@@ ination is genuine in circumstances where the nomin@@ ee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the spon@@ sor@@ ing business . &quot;
Bus@@ in@@ esses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 vis@@ a holders after previously businesses who had intended to spon@@ sor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 35@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old Sri L@@ ank@@ an as@@ yl@@ um seeker died of a susp@@ ected heart attack after arri@@ ving on an as@@ yl@@ um boat at Christ@@ mas Island this week .
The man &apos;s dist@@ ra@@ ught nin@@ e-@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comfor@@ ted since the death of his father on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day by an adult c@@ ous@@ in who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christ@@ mas Island Hospital , where he died .
A study aim@@ ing to increase the benefits to Scot@@ land of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .
The work by H@@ S@@ 2 Ltd suggests high@@ -@@ speed services to Scot@@ land and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 20@@ 26 .
Transport minister Bar@@ on@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;
Scot@@ tish transport minister Ke@@ ith B@@ rown said he was &quot; excited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .
Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Man@@ ch@@ ester and L@@ eeds .
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high@@ -@@ speed link between London and the North of England from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ b@@ n .
The UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scot@@ land , has instruc@@ ted H@@ S@@ 2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scot@@ land .
This is to include the possibility of event@@ ual journey times from Gl@@ as@@ g@@ ow and Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh to London of three hours or less .
Bar@@ on@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said : &quot; Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;
We are driving forward H@@ S@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
But it is also about connectivity , across the UK 18 cities including Gl@@ as@@ g@@ ow and Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh will be better connected because of H@@ S@@ 2 .
Scot@@ tish Secretary A@@ list@@ air C@@ arm@@ ic@@ hael added : &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scot@@ land . &quot;
For the Scot@@ tish government , Ke@@ ith B@@ rown called on Mr C@@ arm@@ ic@@ hael to &quot; un@@ equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ ally &quot; back Scot@@ land &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr B@@ rown said : &quot; High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scot@@ land , but also adds Scot@@ land &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;
So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scot@@ land , creating benefit for all and compl@@ em@@ enting the Gl@@ as@@ g@@ ow@@ -@@ Ed@@ in@@ bur@@ gh line which the Scot@@ tish Government is already planning .
I look forward to re@@ viewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
Air@@ craft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian air@@ line passengers will need to continue turning off their t@@ abl@@ ets and smart ph@@ ones during tak@@ e-@@ off and land@@ ing despite moves in the US to lo@@ osen regulations covering the devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American car@@ riers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-@@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot; air@@ plane &quot; mode .
Pass@@ engers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it anno@@ ying to be unable to access their e-@@ books during tak@@ e-@@ off@@ s and land@@ ings .
Australian car@@ riers are looking at the decision , which requires US car@@ riers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphas@@ ised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
&quot; CA@@ SA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said &quot; The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft oper@@ ators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cre@@ w members . &quot;
Vir@@ gin , which has already been talking to CA@@ SA about extending the use its in-@@ flight wi@@ -@@ f@@ i entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regul@@ ator .
&quot; We would welcome a review by CA@@ SA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in-@@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , &quot; a spo@@ k@@ esman said .
Q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during tak@@ e-@@ off and land@@ ing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
The FA@@ A ruling applies to American air@@ lines .
However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FA@@ A &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
For US car@@ riers , the impact of the ruling will vary from air@@ line to air@@ line and will depend on the age of their fle@@ et .
C@@ arri@@ ers will need to prove their planes can toler@@ ate radio interference from mobile devices as well as rev@@ ise man@@ uals , training materials , car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage programs and passenger bri@@ ef@@ ings .
&quot; Once an air@@ line ver@@ ifies the tolerance of its fle@@ et , it can allow passengers to use hand@@ held , light@@ weight electronic devices such as t@@ abl@@ ets , e-@@ readers , and s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones@@ -@@ at all al@@ titudes , &quot; the FA@@ A said .
In rare instances of low visi@@ bility , the cre@@ w will instruc@@ t passengers to turn off their devices during land@@ ing .
The group also recommended that heav@@ ier devices should be safely st@@ owed under seats or in over@@ head b@@ ins during tak@@ e-@@ off and land@@ ing .
P@@ aw@@ n@@ bro@@ kers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
At a pa@@ w@@ n@@ shop in B@@ end@@ em@@ eer shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga is sw@@ apping a gold b@@ angle , ring and pair of ear@@ r@@ ings to pay her daughters &quot; school fees .
&quot; My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mr@@ s Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga says .
Even though she ear@@ ns S $ 3,@@ 000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is in@@ sufficient , she says .
Indeed , such is demand across parts of sou@@ the@@ ast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pa@@ w@@ n@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
P@@ aw@@ ning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,@@ 300 in Ms Am@@ ir@@ thal@@ inga &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
Typ@@ ically pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 per cent offered at United Over@@ seas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
However , pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers have the advantage of not requ@@ iring credit chec@@ ks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ w@@ n@@ shops as families feel the squ@@ ee@@ ze from rising living costs and bal@@ lo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , low@@ er@@ - and mid@@ d@@ le@@ -@@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
This week Standard &amp; Po@@ or &apos;s , the rating agency , c@@ ited increasing household lever@@ age , mainly from rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; cred@@ it@@ worth@@ iness .
It said that Malay@@ sia , Tha@@ iland and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product rati@@ os in Asia .
Malay@@ sia top@@ ped the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
Econ@@ om@@ ists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Tha@@ iland , which this week nar@@ row@@ ly emerged from technical rec@@ ession .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , data showed continued export weakness , and a sof@@ tening in consumer demand .
&quot; Bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to suppl@@ ement their income wherever they can , &quot; says S@@ ong Sen@@ g W@@ un , econom@@ ist at CI@@ MB , a Malay@@ sian bank .
Hist@@ or@@ ically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pa@@ wn personal belong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery .
In Singapore , about 70 per cent of items pa@@ w@@ ned at the c@@ it@@ y-@@ state &apos;s 200 pa@@ wn out@@ lets are gold .
&quot; People are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pa@@ wn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month , &quot; &quot; says Mr S@@ ong .
In Tha@@ iland the largest pa@@ w@@ n@@ shop operator , E@@ as@@ y@@ Money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its out@@ lets in recent months .
Such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max , operator of the out@@ let at B@@ end@@ em@@ eer and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malay@@ sia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Y@@ e@@ ah L@@ ee Ch@@ ing , Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max &apos;s executive director .
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 6@@ 6@@ m it raised this week in a li@@ sting on the Singapore stock exchange .
While some discount l@@ enders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Y@@ e@@ ah says that not only does pa@@ w@@ ning offer che@@ aper rates than other l@@ enders , it also does not add directly to debt .
&quot; Custom@@ ers are mort@@ g@@ aging items that they already own , and mon@@ e@@ tis@@ ing personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .
There &apos;s an increased social acceptance of pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
Nor are the types of people who use pa@@ w@@ n@@ bro@@ kers only the fin@@ anci@@ ally stretched .
Weal@@ thy people in Singapore also use Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max out@@ lets , pa@@ w@@ ning gold bars or Rol@@ ex wat@@ ches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
We see customers from all walks of life .
&quot; They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ assi@@ e health
The Federal Government in@@ si@@ sts a $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can &apos;@@ t waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister Tan@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constra@@ ints .
The funding , over four years , was decided after government consul@@ tations with T@@ as@@ man@@ ian independent MP An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today .
The $ 3@@ 25 million package includes a $ 31 million el@@ ective surgery bl@@ it@@ z .
An additional 26@@ 00 operations including or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ dic and cat@@ ar@@ act surgery will help clear a back@@ log .
There &apos;s also money for wal@@ k@@ -@@ in clin@@ ics in H@@ ob@@ art and La@@ unc@@ est@@ on , better after@@ -@@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the rol@@ l@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
&quot; These investments respond to the ideas that fron@@ t-@@ line clin@@ icians have told me will be the best ways to tend to T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
The minister insisted the T@@ as@@ man@@ ian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
A th@@ ree@@ -@@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and e@@ fficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie today said the $ 3@@ 25 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable fo@@ oting . &quot;
He n@@ evertheless praised the Government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m hop@@ eful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said .
According to the State Government these additional el@@ ective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But federal Op@@ position health spo@@ k@@ esman Pet@@ er Dut@@ ton believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; band@@ -@@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; The reason we are here is that the Lab@@ or State Government ri@@ pped $ 4@@ 30 million out of its health system , &quot; he told A@@ BC TV .
You can &apos;@@ t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost hal@@ f-@@ a-@@ billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $ 300 million and pret@@ end it &apos;s a good news day .
Mr Dut@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureau@@ cr@@ acy .

Syri@@ a has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , watch@@ dog group says
Syri@@ a has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas m@@ uni@@ tions , the global chemical weapons watch@@ dog said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day as fi@@ erce cl@@ ashes r@@ aged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored .
Also Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , a Syri@@ an activ@@ ist group said more than 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
The announcement by the Organization for the Pro@@ hibition of Chem@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons came one day ahead of the No@@ v .
1 de@@ ad@@ line set by The H@@ ag@@ u@@ e-@@ based organization for Dam@@ asc@@ us to destroy or &quot; render in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mix@@ ing chemicals into poison gas and filling m@@ uni@@ tions .
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious tim@@ eline that aims to destroy all of Dam@@ asc@@ us &apos; chemical weapons by mid@@ -@@ 2014 .
De@@ struction of the equipment means that Syri@@ a can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ asc@@ us still has to start destro@@ ying existing weapons and stoc@@ k@@ pil@@ es .
The country is believed to have around 1,@@ 000 met@@ ric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sar@@ in .
The announcement came as fighting r@@ aged Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day in the town of Saf@@ ira , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Brit@@ ain@@ -@@ based Syri@@ an Ob@@ serv@@ atory for Human Rights .
The activ@@ ist group , which has been trac@@ king the death tol@@ l through a network of ac@@ tivi@@ sts in Syri@@ a , said Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day that 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 29@@ 6 people have died .
Of those , it said 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are ci@@ v@@ ili@@ ans , including 6,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
On the government side , it said 29@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 are members of President Bas@@ har As@@ sad &apos;s armed forces , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro@@ -@@ government fighters and 187 are Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bol@@ lah milit@@ ants .
Also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 army def@@ ectors and some 5,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition fighters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
On July 25 , the U@@ .@@ N. estimated 10@@ 0,@@ 000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated that figure since .
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country .
As@@ sad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling reb@@ els , many of them linked to al@@ -@@ Qa@@ ida groups , in Saf@@ ira for weeks .
The Ob@@ serv@@ atory said there were cas@@ u@@ alties on both sides Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day but had no speci@@ fic@@ s .
The fighting under@@ sco@@ red the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspec@@ tors face as they race against tight de@@ ad@@ lines in their mission to rid Syri@@ a of the toxic ar@@ sen@@ al in the midst of an ongoing civil war .
A statement from the O@@ PC@@ W , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syri@@ a &apos;s declared critical production and mix@@ ing / filling equipment . &quot;
It added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed their first round of verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ asc@@ us .
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspec@@ tors said .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day , O@@ PC@@ W said the two locations were , according to Syri@@ a , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were insp@@ ected . &quot;
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Saf@@ ira was one of the two sites that O@@ PC@@ W inspec@@ tors were not able to visit .
Syri@@ a has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the O@@ PC@@ W &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the for@@ titude and courage you &apos;@@ ve all demonstrated in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the watch@@ dog &apos;s direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general , Ah@@ met Uz@@ um@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the O@@ PC@@ W .
Now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sun@@ ni Muslim reb@@ els against As@@ sad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are st@@ ac@@ ked with members of his A@@ law@@ ite sect , an off@@ shoot of Shi@@ ite Islam .
In other developments , the Ob@@ serv@@ atory &apos;s chief Ram@@ i Ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man said there had been a strong explos@@ ion W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day inside an air def@@ ense facility in Syri@@ a &apos;s coastal province of Lat@@ ak@@ ia .
The cause of the blast was not known , he said .
Police seized a forged regi@@ stry , forged se@@ als , a lap@@ top and phot@@ oc@@ op@@ ies of registration documents from the accused .
Mot@@ i Nagar police have registered a case against the accused .
Police commission@@ er Param@@ jit Singh said that those arrested and accused are H@@ ai@@ bo@@ val Rajiv A@@ gar@@ wal a@@ .@@ k@@ .@@ a. B@@ int@@ u from Chand@@ an Nagar , from G@@ hum@@ ar Mand@@ i , Kam@@ al K@@ r@@ ush@@ na Ja@@ is@@ wal , Gur@@ win@@ der Singh Jag@@ gi from Ko@@ ha@@ da and Son@@ u from G@@ hum@@ ar Mand@@ i .
Bal@@ b@@ ir Singh from the Registrar Office ( East ) has fled from the scene .
According to the police the accused used to take out the documents of the records of vac@@ ant and old plots with the help of Bal@@ b@@ ir Singh , a cler@@ k and record keeper in the Registrar Office and then , by purcha@@ sing new stamp papers , used to make counter@@ fe@@ it registration documents for them .
Not only that , but they used to destroy the original regi@@ stry documents and then the false regi@@ stry documents were updated in the records .
Then the accused use to sell the land with counter@@ fe@@ it papers for crores of rupees .
At the same time , they would take out loans against these counter@@ fe@@ it documents .
Thereafter , the original owner would be left running to the police and administration .
Those accused of the counter@@ fe@@ it regi@@ stra@@ tions were especially inter@@ sted in the N@@ RI@@ G plots .
As no@@ -@@ one was looking after the N@@ RI@@ G plots .
So it was easy to forge registration documents and sell the land .
The Police Commissioner said that , upon inter@@ ro@@ gation , the accused said that they had made about 150 counter@@ fe@@ it regi@@ stra@@ tions so far .
According to police Rajiv , the leader of the gan@@ g , already has a criminal record for fra@@ ud and the@@ ft .

He could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ ole .
The 4@@ 5@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of K@@ uta which left 20@@ 2 people dead , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and injured sco@@ res more .
He was also found guilty of a number of other terror@@ is@@ m@@ -@@ related charges , including a wave of bomb@@ ings of chur@@ ches across Indonesia on Christ@@ mas E@@ ve in 2000 .
Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; Dem@@ ol@@ ition Man &quot; for his reputation as a master bomb@@ -@@ maker be sent@@ enced to death .
The decision has re@@ ign@@ ited painful memories for Per@@ th mother June Cor@@ teen , who lost her 3@@ 9@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old twin daughters Jan@@ e and J@@ enn@@ y in the destruction un@@ le@@ ashed by P@@ ate@@ k and his co-@@ conspir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
F@@ igh@@ ting back tears , she said P@@ ate@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; He should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen told A@@ AP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children , and my daughters .
The S@@ ari Cl@@ ub was lev@@ elled when a massive bomb loaded into a van par@@ ked outside was det@@ on@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Pet@@ er H@@ ugh@@ es was in Pad@@ dy &apos;s Bar where a suicide bom@@ ber det@@ on@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explos@@ i@@ ves just 20 seconds earlier .
He lap@@ sed into a mon@@ th-@@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bomb@@ ing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
Mr H@@ ugh@@ es said P@@ ate@@ k should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ iah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ kh@@ las and Im@@ am Sam@@ udra - who were executed four years ago .
Really , this guy should get the death penalty before anybody .
To keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
To get 20 years , after killing 20@@ 2 people and inj@@ uring many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
P@@ ate@@ k is the last of the B@@ ali bom@@ bers to face justice .
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually appreh@@ ended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Ab@@ bot@@ t@@ abad , where US forces killed former al@@ -@@ Qa@@ eda chief O@@ s@@ ama bin Lad@@ en less than four months later .
During the trial , an F@@ BI agent testi@@ fied that intelligence reports had revealed P@@ ate@@ k was in Pakistan to meet with bin Lad@@ en in an effort to re-@@ establish links between Sou@@ th-@@ East Asian terrorist groups and al@@ -@@ Qa@@ eda .
&quot; He didn &apos;@@ t give himself up , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
Until just recently , he really didn &apos;@@ t feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people .
The ver@@ dict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by ceremon@@ ies in B@@ ali and Australia .
&quot; There will be a lot of tears this year , &quot; Ms Cor@@ teen said .
P@@ ate@@ k may yet appeal his sentence .
FA@@ A : Air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
Air@@ line passengers will be able to use their electronic devices g@@ at@@ e-@@ to-@@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ ph@@ ones - under mu@@ ch@@ -@@ anticip@@ ated new guidelines issued Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers sh@@ ouldn &apos;@@ t expect changes to happen immediately .
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the air@@ line , FA@@ A Admini@@ str@@ ator Michael Hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference .
Air@@ lines will have to show the FA@@ A how their air@@ planes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;@@ ve up@@ dating their flight cre@@ w training man@@ uals and rules for st@@ owing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
The FA@@ A said it has already received plans from some air@@ lines to expand the use of port@@ able electronic devices on planes .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ Blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans .
&quot; Dep@@ ending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FA@@ A said in a statement .
Currently , passengers are required to turn off their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones , t@@ abl@@ ets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door clos@@ es .
They &apos;@@ re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10@@ ,@@ 000 feet and the cap@@ tain gives the go@@ -@@ ahead .
Pass@@ engers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane desc@@ ends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .
Under the new guidelines , air@@ lines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during tak@@ e@@ off@@ s , land@@ ings and tax@@ i@@ ing , the FA@@ A said .
Most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use W@@ if@@ i at higher al@@ titudes are expected to meet the criteria .
La@@ ura Gl@@ ading , president of the Association of Prof@@ essional F@@ light At@@ tend@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;@@ re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win@@ -@@ win , &quot; Gl@@ ading said in a statement .
We &apos;@@ re fr@@ ank@@ ly tired of feeling like &apos; hall mon@@ itors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But connecting to the Internet to sur@@ f , exchange emails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10@@ ,@@ 000 feet , the agency said .
Pass@@ engers will be told to switch their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ones , t@@ abl@@ ets and other devices to air@@ plane mode .
So , still no Words With Friends , the online S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble@@ -@@ type game that actor A@@ le@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his s@@ mar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously bo@@ oted off an American Air@@ lines j@@ et for ref@@ using to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate .
And heav@@ ier devices such as lap@@ tops will continue to have to be st@@ owed because of concern they might inj@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cab@@ in .
In@@ -@@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
Reg@@ ul@@ atory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Commun@@ ications Commission , not the FA@@ A .
FA@@ A may lift ban on some electronic devices during tak@@ e@@ off and land@@ ing
Last month , National Tran@@ spor@@ tation Safety Board Mark Ros@@ en@@ ker , a C@@ BS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell ph@@ ones are still considered a risk .
&quot; Cell ph@@ ones , that really is an issue , not just because pot@@ entially it could create interference with navig@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the F@@ CC , that it could inter@@ fere with cell phone tow@@ ers when they &apos;@@ re in the air , &quot; Ros@@ en@@ ker said .
An industry advis@@ ory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
Pres@@ sure has been building on the FA@@ A in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ . Cla@@ ire Mc@@ Cas@@ kill , D@@ -@@ M@@ o . , cont@@ end there is no valid safety reason for the pro@@ hibitions .
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ub@@ i@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
The FA@@ A began restric@@ ting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navig@@ ation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying F@@ M radi@@ os , the high@@ -@@ t@@ ech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day .
New air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FA@@ A to be resist@@ ant to electronic interference .
Air@@ lines have been offering Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i use at cru@@ ising al@@ titudes to passengers for several years .
Plan@@ es modified for Wi@@ -@@ F@@ i systems are also more resist@@ ant to interference .
The vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should quali@@ fy for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Hu@@ er@@ ta said .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations of devices .
E@@ -@@ readers , for example , em@@ it only min@@ imal trans@@ missions when turning a page .
But trans@@ missions are stronger when devices are down@@ loading or sending data .
Among those pressing for a rela@@ xation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been A@@ ma@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ com .
In 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ lin@@ er full of their K@@ ind@@ le e-@@ readers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none .
FA@@ A advis@@ ory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Dou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line Pass@@ engers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is min@@ imal .
Other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ d@@ otal reports from pil@@ ots to support that the devices can inter@@ fere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
However , the committee recommended the FA@@ A allow pil@@ ots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low visi@@ bility .
A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common@@ -@@ sense accommod@@ ations for a trav@@ eling public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re pleased the FA@@ A recogn@@ izes that an enjo@@ y@@ able passenger experience is not in@@ compatible with safety and security , &quot; said R@@ og@@ er D@@ ow , CE@@ O of the U@@ .@@ S. Travel Association .
After learning the lesson of the Patna Serial Bla@@ sts the UT police in the view of security have become ready to re@@ act quickly to any emergency situation during the Diwali celebrations .
1,@@ 800 Sol@@ di@@ ers will pat@@ rol the major areas of the city in vehicles or on foot , to ensure that the traffic runs sm@@ oo@@ thly to prevent any bag snat@@ ching and to teach the lesson to eve te@@ as@@ ers along with any other mis@@ cre@@ ants .
F@@ em@@ ale police officers will also be involved along with the PC@@ R , Tra@@ ff@@ ic Unit in that Unit .
Police officials and officers , doing their duty promp@@ tly , will insp@@ ect the records of all the other ven@@ ues including hot@@ els , guest houses , and PG accommodation .
The station SH@@ O@@ s have been ordered to set up a Special Investi@@ gation Team ( SI@@ T ) to investi@@ gate the case .
The responsibility of investig@@ ating the V@@ IP sectors of the city along with the markets , m@@ alls , etc. has been assigned to the D@@ SP@@ s along with the inspec@@ tors .
Due to the emergency situation and the Diwali festival , senior officials have deplo@@ yed additional police employees in the control room to facilitate the flow of people .
Other than the Director of the P@@ G@@ I and fire department , Principal Director and DH@@ S Sector 16 G@@ MS@@ H and Sector 32 G@@ MC@@ H staff of other dispens@@ aries were also asked to be on high alert for emer@@ gencies .
To teach a lesson to the go@@ ons the di@@ visional officers have appointed female police officers and others under the leadership of the N@@ G@@ O &apos;s , nam@@ ing them the &quot; Anti Go@@ on Staff &quot; .
The Anti Go@@ on team will be on alert in the crow@@ ded market areas and other crow@@ ded areas in civil@@ ian clothes .
All the SH@@ O@@ s have been ordered to set up 44 posts in the internal parts of the city during Diwali .
Also police officials will be st@@ a@@ tioned at 38 check@@ points on the city borders .
Bir@@ d air@@ lifted to safety from North Sea ri@@ g released back into wild
A bird air@@ lifted ash@@ ore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil ri@@ g has been released back into the wild .
The water rail was put on a hel@@ icop@@ ter to Ab@@ er@@ de@@ en last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scot@@ tish SP@@ CA at its rescue centre in Al@@ lo@@ a .
Centre manager Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don said : &quot; This water rail was likely a winter mi@@ grant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . &quot;
It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil ri@@ g .
He added : &quot; It was unable to fly off again so we were cont@@ acted for help . &quot;
The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
Is Europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with Britain ?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the E@@ U .
To that end , we commission@@ ed the largest and most comprehensive pol@@ l of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the E@@ U .
You@@ Go@@ v pol@@ led over 1,@@ 000 business leaders , broad@@ ly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
The con@@ clu@@ sions of the pol@@ l will come as a surprise to many .
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , foc@@ using on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing while the E@@ U states st@@ agn@@ ate .
They want to see the Government pri@@ or@@ iti@@ se new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ g@@ ged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of re@@ forming the E@@ U &apos;s ar@@ cane institutions .
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key compet@@ ences should be returned to West@@ min@@ ster .
There was general dis@@ content with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro@@ -@@ European of companies , agreed .
Finally , and most t@@ ell@@ ingly of all , our pol@@ l of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the E@@ U that is based on trade , not politics .
This finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is p@@ ushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .
The st@@ akes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent s@@ wing towards voting to stay in the E@@ U in a refer@@ en@@ dum .
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this pol@@ l shows that British business backs his plan for ren@@ e@@ goti@@ ating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the E@@ U .
It also shows that business expects that ren@@ e@@ goti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
A better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the e@@ uro@@ zone embar@@ ks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our pol@@ l show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s &quot; regulatory approach .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s Alex@@ e@@ i M@@ ill@@ er says pi@@ p@@ eline in Bul@@ g@@ aria starts new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stre@@ am gas pi@@ p@@ eline in Bul@@ g@@ aria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s chief said .
&quot; A land@@ mark event has taken place today : Con@@ struction started on the Bul@@ g@@ arian section of the South Stre@@ am gas pi@@ p@@ eline , the most larg@@ e-@@ scale and important project in Europe , &quot; Gaz@@ pro@@ m Chairman Alex@@ e@@ i M@@ ill@@ er said in a statement Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stre@@ am is meant to add diversity to Russia &apos;s export routes through Europe .
A contrac@@ tual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in Ukra@@ ine , which hosts most of Russia &apos;s gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
M@@ ill@@ er said the direct connection to Bul@@ g@@ aria , a member of the European Union , means ge@@ op@@ oli@@ tical risks associated with tran@@ sit countries are elim@@ inated &quot; forever . &quot;
Bul@@ g@@ arian consumers will receive gas from South Stre@@ am at a dis@@ counted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m said construction should begin in other down@@ stream countries by year &apos;s end .
The pi@@ p@@ eline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 tr@@ il@@ lion cub@@ ic feet of natural gas .
The FA@@ A is eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ gets on air@@ planes - though chat@@ ting on cell@@ ph@@ ones will still be prohibited .

Two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jon@@ a@@ than Lord , Royal Commission hears
Two Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah child care worker Jon@@ a@@ than Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot; never dealt with an incident of child sexual assa@@ ult within its organisation , &quot; the Commission was told .
Chief executive officer Ph@@ illi@@ p H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child por@@ no@@ graphy offences , and another when a gy@@ m instruc@@ tor at the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah Hall was convic@@ ted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , counsel assist@@ ing the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
He conc@@ eded the Y@@ M@@ CA &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing &quot; there have been external aud@@ its of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recognised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the fore@@ front of child safety . &quot;
Ev@@ idence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible rat@@ ings in a Department of Education and Comm@@ unities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conc@@ eded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recru@@ iting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy bre@@ aches .
Ear@@ lier this year Lord was convic@@ ted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
He was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
But Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord &apos;s bre@@ aches of child safety .
Staff gave evidence they observed bre@@ aches including Lord being alone with children , bab@@ ys@@ itting them priv@@ ately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and l@@ etting them play with his mobile phone .
D@@ ani@@ el@@ le Oc@@ k@@ well , who was super@@ vised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testi@@ fied she found the Y@@ M@@ CA Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ah children &apos;s services manager J@@ acqu@@ i Bar@@ n@@ at who super@@ vised Lord &quot; very intim@@ id@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
The CE@@ O said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their managers .
Rather , he said , their friend@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their jud@@ g@@ ements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jon@@ a@@ than Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign conf@@ identi@@ ality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children &apos;s services Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said it was intended to avoid contam@@ ination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ z@@ eal@@ ous &quot; and po@@ or@@ ly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA N@@ S@@ W was not a child safe organisation at the time Jon@@ a@@ than Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor St@@ eph@@ en Sm@@ all@@ bone of G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith University told the commission .
He said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , scre@@ ening , in@@ duction , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing ad@@ jour@@ ned until December 20 .
Bla@@ ir says he &apos;@@ d like UK com@@ e@@ back
T@@ ony Bla@@ ir said he &apos;@@ d seize the chance to return as Britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowled@@ ges a com@@ e@@ back is un@@ likely .
In an interview o@@ vern@@ ight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 5@@ 9@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old a@@ ired his views on various domestic policies .
Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader , Mr Bla@@ ir has largely avoided discus@@ sing British politics , con@@ fin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as en@@ vo@@ y to the Quar@@ t@@ et of Middle East peac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers .
As@@ ked if he would return to the post of prime minister , Mr Bla@@ ir was quoted by London &apos;s E@@ ven@@ ing Standard as saying : &quot; Yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
He also urged leaders not to turn their backs on the business community following the financial crisis .
As crow@@ ds of hor@@ se@@ -@@ showing experts gathered in Car@@ diff to battle it out for Hor@@ se of the Year , they knew the competition would be tough .
But nobody was quite ready for th@@ ree@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old F@@ ent@@ on Kir@@ k@@ land .
Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the to@@ dd@@ ler and his pet Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony T@@ off@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three r@@ ounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult oppon@@ ents tr@@ ailing behind .
The in@@ separ@@ able pair - who are the same height - were comm@@ ended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual cont@@ est run by Sun@@ n@@ y@@ bank Equ@@ est@@ ri@@ an Centre , in R@@ ud@@ ry near Car@@ diff .
Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler h@@ ats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded tw@@ o-@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old T@@ off@@ ee around the ring .
F@@ ent@@ on was la@@ uded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
And T@@ off@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
F@@ ent@@ on was given T@@ off@@ ee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Sh@@ et@@ land p@@ ony every day since .
His mother Don@@ na , 30 , said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
They were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and ros@@ ette .
It was only the second time he had comp@@ eted with T@@ off@@ ee and we were all ec@@ static when he won .
Complete strang@@ ers in the ar@@ ena all thought he was so phenomen@@ al they wanted photos taken with him .
The youn@@ g@@ ster , from the village of N@@ ant@@ y@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w V@@ ale , South W@@ ales , is following in the footsteps of his a@@ unt Shar@@ on H@@ ow@@ ells , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
Mr@@ s H@@ ow@@ ells said : &quot; The whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cl@@ apping . &quot;
He was running on sand down the full length of the ar@@ ena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marv@@ ell@@ ous job .
F@@ ent@@ on is animal mad - he loves horses , trac@@ tors and f@@ arms and has got two chick@@ ens which he looks after .
The way he has started he &apos;@@ ll be at the Hor@@ se of the Year show before long - and I &apos;@@ m sure he &apos;@@ ll do well .
A spo@@ k@@ esman for the annual horse show said : &quot; F@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his p@@ ony . &quot;
They are a great team together .
The judges marked F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
They look for good te@@ am@@ work between the p@@ ony and the hand@@ ler - F@@ ent@@ on and T@@ off@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I &apos;@@ m sure F@@ ent@@ on was helped by his c@@ ute clothes , he really looked the part .
China plea paper &apos; to be over@@ ha@@ u@@ led@@ &apos;
A Chinese newspaper that made a fron@@ t-@@ page appeal for the release of a re@@ porter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation is to be over@@ ha@@ ul@@ ed , a press regul@@ ator says .
The Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou@@ -@@ based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journ@@ alist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabricate stories about a part stat@@ e-@@ owned company .
Now the New Express is to undergo &quot; full rec@@ tification , &quot; the regul@@ ator said .
The &quot; rec@@ tification &quot; order came from the Gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong Administration of Press and Publ@@ ication , Radio , Film and Tel@@ evision .
A preliminary investigation showed that Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group &apos;s New Express had published several un@@ true reports about listed company Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .
&quot; New Express &apos;s edit@@ orial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regul@@ ator said in a statement .
It said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by rev@@ o@@ king his re@@ porter &apos;s license . &quot;
It had also &quot; instruc@@ ted Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing News Group to undertake a complete rec@@ tification of New Express , and recommended they investi@@ gate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately rev@@ ise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
Mr Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Express alleg@@ ing financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a construc@@ tion@@ -@@ equipment company called Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion .
After he was det@@ ained , his newspaper published two fron@@ t-@@ page appeals for his release , saying it backed his journalism .
But Mr Ch@@ en then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; In this case I &apos;@@ ve caused damages to Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ CT@@ V .
I did this mainly because I h@@ ank@@ ered after money and fame .
I &apos;@@ ve realised my wrongdoing .
Following Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s ap@@ ology , New Express issued a fron@@ t-@@ page ap@@ ology , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .

US@@ -@@ Mexico drug tun@@ nel with its own railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling tun@@ n@@ els between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric rail systems .
US authorities described the four foot by three foot tun@@ nel as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever discovered .
The tun@@ nel , which z@@ ig@@ z@@ ags the length of nearly six foot@@ ball pit@@ ches , links ware@@ houses near Ti@@ ju@@ ana , Mexico and San Di@@ ego , USA .
The area is filled with non@@ descrip@@ t ware@@ houses , making it easier to conceal tr@@ uc@@ ks being loaded with drugs .
The tun@@ nel was shut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detected , authorities said .
Auth@@ orities seized eigh@@ t-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 3@@ 27 p@@ ounds of coc@@ ain@@ e in connection with the tun@@ nel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
Three men who authorities say worked as dri@@ vers were charged with possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and coc@@ ain@@ e with intent to distribute .
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convic@@ ted .
In N@@ og@@ ales , Ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers tap into vast underground dra@@ inage can@@ als .
The tun@@ nel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Di@@ ego since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els have been discovered after central Mexico &apos;s mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in October , which presents drug car@@ t@@ els with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
In 2010 , authorities found a roughly 7@@ 00@@ -@@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ ju@@ ana home to two San Di@@ ego ware@@ houses .

British police serve Ass@@ ange with ex@@ tradition notice
B@@ ti@@ tish police served an ex@@ tradition notice today on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks founder Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who has taken refuge in E@@ cu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in London and requested as@@ yl@@ um .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard said they had served a &quot; surrender notice &quot; on the 4@@ 0@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old Australian requ@@ iring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ ange faces ex@@ tradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations , having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court over@@ turned his appeal against ex@@ tradition earlier this month .
F@@ earing Sto@@ ck@@ hol@@ m would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at E@@ cu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political as@@ yl@@ um .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard has &quot; served a surrender notice upon a 4@@ 0@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choos@@ ing , &quot; a spo@@ k@@ esman said .
He remains in breach of his b@@ ail conditions .
The emb@@ ass@@ y declined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ ange fears he will be extr@@ ad@@ ited from Sweden to the United States to face possible es@@ pion@@ age charges , after releas@@ ing more than 25@@ 0,@@ 000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks anti@@ -@@ sec@@ rec@@ y website .
D@@ river spe@@ eding at 13@@ 0@@ m@@ ph with hot drink between legs fined £ 1,@@ 000
A mot@@ or@@ ist has been fined £ 1,@@ 000 for driving at up to 13@@ 0@@ m@@ ph ( 2@@ 10@@ km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ ie , 35 , of T@@ ip@@ tree , Es@@ sex , was sp@@ otted driving his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 at Bra@@ int@@ ree on 27 May .
When police stopped him they discovered the tak@@ e@@ away drink between his legs .
At Col@@ ch@@ ester Mag@@ i@@ strates &apos; Court H@@ ow@@ ie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six@@ -@@ month driving ban .
H@@ ow@@ ie was also ordered to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim sur@@ charge of £ 100 .
Tax on foreign property owners to burst London &apos;s bub@@ ble
The T@@ reas@@ ury have provisi@@ on@@ ally co@@ sted out the C@@ G@@ T measure but are awa@@ iting a final decision from Mr O@@ s@@ borne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stamp duty for homes co@@ sting more than £ 2@@ m and annual charges for bu@@ yers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
Al@@ ready the stamp duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ough@@ s of West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea , which stood at £ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern I@@ rel@@ and , W@@ ales , Scot@@ land , the North East , North West and Yor@@ ksh@@ ire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr C@@ ook said : &quot; Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti@@ -@@ avo@@ id@@ ance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under@@ -@@ ta@@ xed irrespective of the effect of the out@@ -@@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; But this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluc@@ tant to sell , &quot; he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the afflu@@ ent sou@@ th-@@ west London bel@@ t , which stret@@ ches from Ful@@ ham to W@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
Pr@@ ices in central London continued to show steady y@@ ear@@ -@@ on@@ -@@ year growth of 5.@@ 6 % but were o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and east ( 6@@ .5 % ) all experi@@ encing an up@@ tic@@ k , according to research from Sav@@ ills .
Scienti@@ sts have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .
Ear@@ lier research had revealed that happy do@@ gs wa@@ g their t@@ ails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while nervous do@@ gs have a le@@ ft@@ -@@ dominated s@@ wish .
But now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences .
The study is published in the journal Current Bi@@ ology .
Pr@@ of Geor@@ gi@@ o Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ scientist from the University of Tr@@ en@@ to , said : &quot; It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimul@@ i that invo@@ kes positive or negative emotions . &quot;
Here we attempted to look at it in other species .
He added that just as in humans , for do@@ gs the right side of the brain was responsible for le@@ ft@@ -@@ handed movement and vice vers@@ a , and the two hem@@ is@@ ph@@ er@@ es played different roles in emotions .
To find out more about how do@@ gs re@@ act to the lo@@ p@@ -@@ sided tail w@@ ags of other do@@ gs , the researchers mon@@ it@@ ored the animals as they watched films of other do@@ gs .
They measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analy@@ sed their behaviour .
It will probably not be long before we understand why their t@@ ails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
Pr@@ of Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : &quot; We presented do@@ gs with movies of do@@ gs - either a nat@@ ur@@ alistic version or a sil@@ h@@ ou@@ ette to get rid of any other conf@@ ounding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
When the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail@@ -@@ w@@ agging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they sp@@ otted a tail ve@@ er predomin@@ antly to the left ( again from the tail@@ -@@ sw@@ ishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious .
Pr@@ of Vall@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said he didn &apos;@@ t think that the do@@ gs were inten@@ tionally commun@@ icating with each other through these movements .
Instead , he believes that they do@@ gs have learned from experience what moves they should and sh@@ ouldn &apos;@@ t feel worried about .
He said : &quot; If you have several meetings with other do@@ gs , and frequently their tail w@@ agging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
The researchers say the findings could give owners , v@@ ets and train@@ ers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .
Do@@ g behaviour expert John Br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , a visiting fellow at the University of Bri@@ st@@ ol &apos;s school of veter@@ inary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
Last year a team from the University of Lin@@ col@@ n found that do@@ gs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
And in another research paper from the University of Vic@@ toria in Canada , he said : &quot; D@@ og@@ s were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right , rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;
He said the differences could be because the do@@ gs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the films or robo@@ -@@ do@@ gs as can@@ ines .
A study of how do@@ gs responded to real do@@ gs could help , he explained .
&quot; While there is considerable evidence from many different mamm@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mer@@ ed out - and do@@ gs are no exception , &quot; he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their t@@ ails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .

R@@ ock band the Ar@@ c@@ tic Mon@@ keys have postp@@ oned a gi@@ g in Gl@@ as@@ g@@ ow after their lead singer was diagnos@@ ed with lar@@ yn@@ gitis .
The She@@ ff@@ i@@ eld group were scheduled to perform at the Hy@@ dr@@ o ven@@ ue in the city on Friday .

Pop@@ e Franc@@ is to name first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pop@@ e Franc@@ is will create new car@@ din@@ als of the Cath@@ olic Church for his first time on February 22 , the V@@ ati@@ can announced Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
C@@ ard@@ in@@ als are the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking cl@@ ergy in the Cath@@ olic Church below the pop@@ e , and they &apos;@@ re the ones who elect pop@@ es , so Franc@@ is will be ap@@ pointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
There are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
However , once a car@@ d@@ inal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pop@@ e -@@ - this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ d@@ inal elec@@ tors . &quot;
In a statement announ@@ cing the news , Father Fed@@ er@@ ico L@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a V@@ ati@@ can spo@@ k@@ esman , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consist@@ ory .
&quot; Pop@@ e Franc@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke February &apos;s consist@@ ory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; L@@ om@@ bar@@ di said .
J@@ ack Val@@ ero of Cath@@ olic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of car@@ d@@ inal elec@@ tors was likely to have dropped .
He said usually a pop@@ e would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ d@@ inal elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
Next year &apos;s consist@@ ory would be significant because it would be the first since Franc@@ is was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
At the moment there is a sort of bi@@ as towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
&quot; It will be interesting to see whether the new Pop@@ e will nomin@@ ate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
For@@ ty percent of Roman Cath@@ ol@@ ics are in South America , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
The car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Franc@@ is formed the Council of C@@ ard@@ in@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the ch@@ urch .
In the past the Pop@@ e decided everything on his own .
&quot; Now Franc@@ is has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; Val@@ ero said .
He said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Franc@@ is would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
But we &apos;@@ ve not been in that situation before -@@ - it &apos;s all completely new .
Val@@ ero said pop@@ es typically elevated b@@ ish@@ ops from large places to the position of car@@ d@@ inal but that Franc@@ is was &quot; full of sur@@ prises -@@ - so we don &apos;@@ t know who he &apos;@@ ll name . &quot;
G@@ M rec@@ alls some new p@@ ick@@ up tr@@ uc@@ ks in U@@ .@@ S. to fix se@@ at@@ backs

On some of the tr@@ uc@@ ks , the front seats may have a defect in the rec@@ lining mechanism .
As a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restra@@ ints .
&quot; If the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restraint may not properly protect occup@@ ants , increasing the risk of injury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Tra@@ ff@@ ic Safety Administration website .
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
G@@ M &apos;s tr@@ uck rol@@ l@@ -@@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U@@ .@@ S. autom@@ aker since its 2009 bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy re@@ struc@@ turing .
G@@ M told tr@@ uck owners about the defect in the first half of October .
N@@ HT@@ SA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16@@ -@@ day government sh@@ ut@@ down , which temper@@ ed auto sales growth in October .
Sal@@ es of the Sil@@ ver@@ ad@@ o and Si@@ er@@ ra tr@@ uc@@ ks , which were re@@ designed for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , G@@ M said on Friday .
In October , G@@ M sold 4@@ 2,@@ 6@@ 60 Sil@@ ver@@ ad@@ o and 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 03 Si@@ er@@ ra p@@ ick@@ up tr@@ uc@@ ks .
G@@ M shares were up 1.@@ 4 percent at $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
An Obama vot@@ er &apos;s cry of despair
I v@@ oted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by GO@@ P obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
Ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;@@ t excuse Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website w@@ oes , dr@@ one attacks
Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad reminder of what might have been
N@@ ath@@ aniel P. Mor@@ r@@ is is a second@@ -@@ year student at Har@@ v@@ ard Medical School .
I &apos;@@ m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days .
It &apos;s a book that I thought would upl@@ i@@ ft me during the dol@@ dr@@ ums of second@@ -@@ year medical school , and ren@@ ew in me a sense of hope .
It &apos;s called &quot; The Aud@@ acity to W@@ in , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ o@@ ir of Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s 2008 presid@@ ential campaign .
When I &apos;@@ m finished with my patient writ@@ e-@@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away .
The election turned out to be a land@@ sli@@ de , and news anch@@ ors pa@@ used to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
My class@@ mates cried with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
A young team of visi@@ on@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
And then I close the book .
C@@ utting to the present is a r@@ ude awakening , like sn@@ apping out of a dream .
It &apos;s hard to remember those days of optimis@@ m -@@ - they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of opportunities gone by .
Change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first bal@@ lot .
It was simply nothing I could have imagined .
I credit Obama with great and varied accompl@@ ishments , from the passage of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;@@ t ask don &apos;@@ t tell , &quot; to the killing of O@@ s@@ ama bin Lad@@ en .
Moreover , I believe that par@@ tis@@ an obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward : im@@ migration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Gu@@ ant@@ an@@ am@@ o Bay , among others .
But , after the coun@@ tless times in which I have found myself def@@ ending the Obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers , I &apos;@@ ve reached a limit to the ex@@ plan@@ ations that I can provide .
I &apos;@@ ve reached a point of political despair .
Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ an obstruc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders , nor having dr@@ ones strike innocent children overseas .
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosec@@ uting wh@@ ist@@ le@@ -@@ blow@@ ers who reveal government wrongdoing .
It cannot account for ass@@ ass@@ inating An@@ war al@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ lak@@ i , an American citizen , without a trial , nor sh@@ ir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presid@@ ential campa@@ igns .
It cannot jus@@ tify the findings of a report that says the White House &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the Ni@@ x@@ on Administration . &quot;
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act was signed into law .
I don &apos;@@ t know if this is what I should have expected .
If , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradic@@ t the political campa@@ igns that preced@@ e it .
Ob@@ viously , el@@ ective office isn &apos;@@ t a predic@@ table course , as the op@@ posing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town mass@@ acre , will shape our public conversation .
Yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choos@@ ing .
That is what trou@@ bles me most of all .
I v@@ oted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was excited by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
M@@ it@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pres@@ su@@ res of future elections , would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
Still , as Obama &apos;s approval rating s@@ ank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
It makes me y@@ earn for the many promises that disappeared .
This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Cl@@ int@@ on in the Pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia primary .
At a post@@ -@@ mor@@ tem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; I want us to get our mo@@ j@@ o back , &quot; he said .
We &apos;@@ ve got to remember who we are . &apos; 
It &apos;s five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn &apos;@@ t agree with you more .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of N@@ ath@@ aniel Mor@@ r@@ is .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims PM T@@ ony Ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest over par@@ ental leave scheme
B@@ illi@@ on@@ aire MP C@@ live Pal@@ mer says Prime Minister T@@ ony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his par@@ ental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it .
The mining magn@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Sen@@ ate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are a@@ xed .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; He &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid par@@ ental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant , he &apos;@@ ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; Mr Pal@@ mer said .
Two months after the election , the electoral commission offic@@ ially declared Mr Pal@@ mer the win@@ ner of the Sun@@ shine Co@@ ast seat of F@@ air@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after a rec@@ ount .
Mr Pal@@ mer called for over@@ ha@@ ul of election counting to speed up the process .
T@@ ony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughters Fr@@ ances and Bri@@ d@@ get .
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; We need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
Why is it that we sh@@ ouldn &apos;@@ t have a system where you can walk in , pun@@ ch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also critic@@ ised the use of p@@ enc@@ ils to mark bal@@ lots .
Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn &apos;@@ t like it ?
In this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the Sun@@ shine Co@@ ast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
Public office is about public service .
&quot; We seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
Because of this the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had to suffer .
Addres@@ sing those gathered for the occasion , the Bar Association President , Ram@@ esh Singh N@@ eg@@ i , expressed strong indi@@ gn@@ ation at the deteri@@ or@@ ating law and order situation in the state .
He said that the growing number of attacks on the advoc@@ ates and their families shows that the criminals have become fear@@ less .
They are not afraid of the police and administration system any more .
C@@ iting various such attacks taking place at different places he said that , if the lawyers themselves are not safe , then we can surely understand how much less safe is the general pub@@ ic .
R@@ BS sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x traders
Royal Bank of Scot@@ land has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global pro@@ be by regul@@ ators into the susp@@ ected manip@@ ulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction .
Some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including U@@ BS , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ BS , have confirmed they are co-@@ operating with regul@@ ators in investig@@ ations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
The two traders would be the first R@@ BS employees to be suspended in the wid@@ ening pro@@ be that ech@@ oes the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank lending manip@@ ulation sc@@ and@@ al .
The bank , which declined to comment on the sus@@ pen@@ sions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regul@@ ators .
&quot; Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-@@ operating fully with the F@@ CA and our other regul@@ ators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
Last month , people close to the situation said that R@@ BS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regul@@ ator , the Financial Con@@ duct Authority , sent to and from a former trader .
This trader , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ BS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of fore@@ x spot trading at J@@ PM@@ organ .
Ro@@ han Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of European spot trading at C@@ iti , went on leave this week , while Mat@@ t Gard@@ in@@ er , a former senior curr@@ encies trader at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ BS , was suspended by Standard Char@@ tered this week .
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s instant message group included ban@@ kers at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Citi@@ group , people close to the situation said .
U@@ BS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Sw@@ iss regul@@ ator , Fin@@ ma , said it was investig@@ ating susp@@ ected manip@@ ulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Sw@@ iss banks .
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , Swit@@ zer@@ land &apos;s competition authority We@@ ko , the F@@ CA , the Department of Justice in the US and the H@@ ong K@@ ong Mon@@ etary Authority - are looking at allegations that ban@@ kers coll@@ uded to move the curr@@ encies market .
H@@ S@@ BC , Citi@@ group , J@@ PM@@ organ and Credit Su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requests for information from regul@@ ators , said people familiar with the situation .
Banks are scour@@ ing through years &quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing .
News about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit dri@@ vers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low vol@@ ati@@ l@@ ity in curr@@ encies cuts opportunities for spec@@ ul@@ ators .
Some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manip@@ ulate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ mentation of liqu@@ idity between different trading plat@@ forms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal plat@@ forms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
The news came on the same day as Credit Su@@ is@@ se announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange tr@@ aded funds des@@ k this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
The bank promp@@ tly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-@@ operating with its regul@@ ators .
&quot; We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Su@@ is@@ se said .
The students studying various courses , including technical and administrative courses , will be able to exercise their right to vote .
The University Vice-@@ Chancell@@ or wrote to the govern@@ or seeking permission to hold elections .
The University Students &apos; Union had demanded to begin the election process .
They also organised a petition to support the campaign and make their voices heard by the university administration and college management .

The Vice-@@ Chancell@@ or , Dr. Ash@@ ok Kumar , said that the university has sought permission from the Governor for the election .
Once approval is obtained the election date will be announced .
He said it is the responsibility of the college administration to hold elections in other colleges .
Many colleges do not want to hold Stud@@ ent Union elections in their campus .
However , due to the lack of unity among the students , elections were not being held .
The Union organised a petition for elections .

Sal@@ es have increased by 20 to 30 % since last year .
People crow@@ ded the jewellery shops in Sim@@ la .
The uten@@ sil shops set up in lower B@@ aj@@ ar to Ma@@ al road were crow@@ ded .

Supreme Court up@@ holds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Bar@@ ack Obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
By a 5@@ -@@ 4 vote , the jus@@ tices ruled the Pati@@ ent Protection and Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
Chief Justice John Rob@@ er@@ ts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while J@@ us@@ tices Scal@@ ia , Thomas , Ali@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy dis@@ sen@@ ted .
The court also up@@ held the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medic@@ aid eligi@@ bility or else lose all federal Medic@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve .
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
The law was vigor@@ ously opposed by each of the major Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ an presid@@ ential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including presum@@ p@@ tive nomin@@ ee M@@ it@@ t Rom@@ ney .
It &apos;s true that we cannot even move without money .
Money is one of the most important requirements for survival , but considering it as the most important thing is not in our best interest .
We celebrate Dhan@@ ter@@ as on Krishna Tra@@ y@@ od@@ ash@@ i in the month of Kar@@ ti@@ ka .
Ku@@ ber , the lord of wealth , and Y@@ ama , the lord of death Y@@ ama are worshipped during Dhan@@ ter@@ as .
Money plays an important part in our religion and life .
Money is neither good nor bad .
It is our attitude towards money that is good or bad .
There is nothing more valuable than wealth that is used for the well-being of mankind , but if wealth becomes the cause of ego , then it is of no value .
We@@ alth should be earned with a sacred objective and should also be spent on sacred objectives .
It is the duty of everyone to earn money for the well-being of the family .
There should also be some sense of social expenditure , but the tendency to the un@@ limited accum@@ ulation or creation of wealth by any means can be bad for our conscience and personality .
There should always be a spirit of charity on our minds .
Even a fraction of your wealth , given by you , can become the basis of someone &apos;s livelihood .
Many people in society are living in extreme poverty . We all must think about them .
In fact wealth , religion , desire and salvation have been given equal importance in all walks of life .
Everyone wishes for wealth and success and depending on how hard they work they achieve wealth and success .
Only wealth gained with self-@@ respect is long lasting .
No criminal , no matter how wealthy he becomes , can never enjoy his wealth in the correct manner and nor can he be useful to others .
Do not env@@ y someone who has money .
True wealthy is the one which makes it possible for wealth to flow through numerous hands .
There is no more appropriate use for wealth than that of creating jobs for others .
Also bear in mind , wealth does not come only in the form of money .
Health , character and love for others is also a kind of wealth .
Try to gain possession of this kind of wealth .
This morning in Agra a sub-@@ inspec@@ tor lost his life and four people were severely injured after a direct coll@@ ision between a tr@@ uck and a police J@@ eep .

To achieve their set targets the In@@ come-@@ Tax Department has plans to start a campaign for collecting advance tax from tax pay@@ ers .
More than 100 NGOs , along with the Executive Management committee of the Maha@@ bo@@ dhi Temple , declared a World Her@@ itage centre , were sent notices by the Department .
School students are also future tax pay@@ ers .
The official have started reaching out to them too .
The G@@ aya Zone Deputy Director Sa@@ ur@@ abh Kumar Rai announced details of the de@@ partmental action plan on Tu@@ es@@ day to &apos; Jag@@ aran &apos; .
The Deputy Director said that the target for the current financial year was around Rs . 9 crores .
Out of which 40 percent will be obtained through T@@ DS and T@@ CS .
There are many sources from which to collect the remaining amount .
He said an appeal is being made to tax pay@@ ers to pay their advance taxes .
De@@ partmental actions are being brought against the tax de@@ faul@@ ters .
Similarly there is a plan to self-@@ motiv@@ ate the tax pay@@ ers to pay .
For this reason officials have gone to the I@@ MA , the Cham@@ ber of Commerce and other institutions in G@@ aya .
He said that the Chief Commissioner of income tax has come to pay a visit after an invitation from the Cham@@ ber .
He said that there is a strategy to spread awareness about taxes among the students from 9th to 12 grade .
For this purpose he himself has met with many school students .
Children can also encourage their parents to be good tax pay@@ ers .
He said there are a total of 4@@ 2,@@ 000 members in the income tax department .
This includes officers down to cler@@ ical staff .
He said that in the last financial year the department collected 5 lakh crores in taxes .
Deputy director Rai said that he was going to ask the commercial tax department for the records of any action taken against tax de@@ faul@@ ters .
The program started with the National An@@ them and the lighting of the lamp by all the guests .
Director , Dr@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ K@@ .@@ Gar@@ g , said that the institution &apos;s annual function is celebrated as the foundation day .
During this the alum@@ ni and students who have achieved the top position in the University are awarded the &quot; Cash A@@ chiev@@ ement Award &quot; .
For various competi@@ tions such as Me@@ h@@ end@@ i , deb@@ ating skills , An@@ tak@@ sh@@ ari , dancing , singing and com@@ edy shows pri@@ zes were presented to the winners .
The principal guest District Coll@@ ector , Nav@@ deep R@@ in@@ wa , and special guest , the Principal of the L@@ L@@ R@@ M medical college , Dr. Prad@@ eep Bharati , appreciated the management initiatives .
The program was presided over by Cha@@ ud@@ hari Vik@@ ram Chandra Go@@ yal , Vice-@@ Chancell@@ or of Char@@ an Singh University , who said that the institution had honoured the University .
At the end of the function all the guests were given sha@@ w@@ ls and mem@@ ent@@ oes .
Before that Chairman Dr. S@@ .@@ P Desh@@ wal said that the aim was to provide the nation with the best and most worthy citizens by providing high quality education for students from all walks of life , who would help in moving the country forward .
Ar@@ n@@ av Cha@@ kra@@ var@@ ti and Jag@@ vi@@ j@@ ay assisted during the function .

In a hearing held behind closed doors , after accepting the plea of the NI@@ A , special Judge I@@ .@@ S. Me@@ hta has placed Ahmed on rem@@ and for 14 days .
According to sources , when presenting U@@ j@@ air Ahmed to the court , the NI@@ A said that U@@ j@@ air Ahmed was also among those accused of the Patna Serial Bomb@@ ings , along with Im@@ ti@@ ya@@ a@@ z Ans@@ ari and Ha@@ ider who are members of the Indian Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ide@@ en .
Ahmed had brought many other terrorists to Ans@@ ari .
The NI@@ A wants to find the other susp@@ ects in this case by inter@@ rog@@ ating Ahmed .
The search for bomb@@ -@@ making material and the terrorists who made those bomb@@ s is still going on , in this case .
They have to take Ahmed to Bihar , Jharkhand and many other states to do this and to facilitate this Ahmed &apos;s rem@@ and is essential .
It should be noted that the NI@@ A had arrested the man accused of the Patna Serial B@@ om@@ b blast , U@@ j@@ air Ahmed from Ran@@ chi , on October 30th .
The special Task Force ( ST@@ F ) exposed the fra@@ ud in the 2012 PM@@ T just a day ago .
The ST@@ F found discre@@ pan@@ cies in the en@@ rol@@ ment numbers of 700 students .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st them almost 125 students had been admitted into medical college .
Now these students ad@@ missions will be declared void .
After the ST@@ F &apos;s revelation the medical examination department has started considering canc@@ elling these students &apos; ad@@ missions .
According to the information provided the department is waiting for a complete list of all susp@@ ect students from the ST@@ F .
The list will be sent to the PE@@ B to rev@@ oke the eligi@@ bility of the students involved .
Although , in this case , the department is also thinking of taking legal advice .
The de@@ partmental officials said that the students en@@ rolled in 2012 have completed one year , so taking legal advice is necessary .
As the case is now under an ST@@ F enquiry , Department of Medical Education officials are not in a position to make a statement .
The PE@@ B director , Tar@@ un P@@ ith@@ ore , said , &quot; If the ST@@ F provides us the list of susp@@ ected students with proof , then their admission would be cancelled immediately &quot; .
The Director of Medical Education , Dr@@ .@@ Nir@@ bha@@ y Sri@@ v@@ ast@@ ava , also said , &quot; If the students &apos; ad@@ missions were found to be forged , we would cancel their ad@@ missions &quot; .
According to ST@@ F officials the forged student ad@@ missions included in the PM@@ T for the year 2012 are under investigation .
After the investigation a list of the susp@@ ected students will be given to the PE@@ B .
It is note@@ worthy that in the PM@@ T exam@@ s for the year 2013 the eligi@@ bility of 3@@ 45 susp@@ ect students was resc@@ ind@@ ed .
Out of these 3@@ 45 , the Department of Medical Education has already resc@@ ind@@ ed 84 student ad@@ missions .
E@@ ja@@ z Ja@@ an , the legisl@@ ator of the Po@@ on@@ ch Assembly Constitu@@ ency , set up a water cool@@ er in the Gur@@ ud@@ wara grounds .
The legisl@@ ator said that quite a lot of people visit the Gur@@ ud@@ wara , but due to the lack of proper water facilities a water cool@@ er has been installed here .
Using this , people can get cold water in the summer .
P@@ ure ordinary water will also be available during the winter season .
This will solve the drinking water problem of the devotees .
Other people were also present at the event , including the Gur@@ ud@@ wara Committee members .
If , after the general election , the new government continued the policy of not selling ker@@ os@@ ene through ration shops then in half a dozen states ker@@ os@@ ene would not be sold in these shops .
The Punjab , Haryana , Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are among the states where the sale of ker@@ os@@ ene sale will be stopped .
In addition to these , Karnataka , Tam@@ il@@ n@@ adu and some states in the nor@@ th-@@ east are also preparing to stop the sale of ker@@ os@@ ene .
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry the decision to stop the sale of ker@@ os@@ ene through P@@ DS shops is based on two criteria .
The first criter@@ ion is that an electricity supply are being installed in the rural areas at a rapid pace .
The second criter@@ ion is the L@@ PG supply network .
This means that in those states where most households in the rural areas have gas connections the sale of P@@ DS ker@@ os@@ ene will be stopped .
The Petroleum Ministry is fully prepared for this .
Since October 2013 the sale of P@@ DS ker@@ os@@ ene in Delhi has already been stopped .
According to sources , under this policy the ker@@ os@@ ene quota of Punjab , Haryana , Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly .
The Punjab quota of 2.@@ 72 lakh kil@@ ol@@ it@@ res was reduced to one lakh kil@@ ol@@ it@@ res .
The ker@@ os@@ ene quota allocation for Haryana was reduced by 70 % and for Uttarakhand it was reduced by almost 40 % .
Despite this reduction no shortage of ker@@ os@@ ene has been reported by these states .
The Ministry is assuming that it is clear that ker@@ os@@ ene is used for adulter@@ ation .
The difference in the price of di@@ esel and P@@ DS ker@@ os@@ ene is currently R@@ s@@ .@@ 37 .
This encour@@ ages those who carrying out adulter@@ ation .
In the states where the sale of ker@@ os@@ ene through P@@ DS shops has been stopped , the oil companies can sell ker@@ os@@ ene at full price on the open market .
At present the oil companies are selling ker@@ os@@ ene at a loss of R@@ s@@ .@@ 39 per lit@@ re .
The burden of the ker@@ os@@ ene subsidy in the year 201@@ 3@@ -@@ 14 is estimated to be 3@@ 1,@@ 000 crore rupees .
Cla@@ im@@ ing to be a trading firm the accused opened accounts for investors and in the name of selling and purcha@@ sing shares , committed fra@@ ud .
It is possibly the first time in the state that this type of fra@@ ud , worth crores of rupees , has been discovered and exposed .
The police have not yet been able to catch the leader of the gan@@ g , but the police have det@@ ained seven people including the accused , after examining his work in the state .
This gan@@ g ran a fic@@ ti@@ tious commodity market named Met@@ at@@ rad@@ er@@ -@@ 5 .
Company exec@@ u@@ tives used to take cash from investors and with the help of bo@@ gus software used to create f@@ ake ID@@ s .
With these , the accused could see the shares the investors were buying .
They also used to known which shares were being purchased and at what price .
In reality no shares were purchased , nor any transactions carried out , because no DE@@ MA@@ T account was opened for the investors and share prices were fal@@ sely displayed in the fic@@ ti@@ tious software .
Police estimate that hundreds of people had been def@@ ra@@ uded by the gan@@ g .
Every investor was asked to invest from two to five lakhs to get good returns .
The main susp@@ ect , Am@@ it Son@@ i , was det@@ ained by the cy@@ ber cell from Jodhpur , while his six associates were arrested in Ind@@ ore .
According to the cy@@ ber cell AD@@ G , Ash@@ ok Do@@ h@@ are , every stock trading company has to join the Stock Exchange as a trading firm .
Only after that can the company can get investors to do stock trading through them .
Then the investor &apos;s DE@@ MA@@ T account is opened , so that the stock can be tr@@ aded , but this company Met@@ a@@ Tr@@ ad@@ er@@ -@@ 5 was neither associated with any exchange , nor was carrying out any stock trading .
This company purchased a server on 24@@ th September 2012 under the name of Win@@ trade .
Since then this company has been def@@ ra@@ ud@@ ing people with f@@ ake investments .
So far , eight traders from Ind@@ ore have come forward with complaints to the cy@@ ber cell .
After selling their shares at a profit the amount was not transferred into their accounts .
Then they started asking for the promised profit from the exec@@ u@@ tives of the company .
Invest@@ ors are even saying that their f@@ ake ID@@ s always showed a reduction in the price of their purchased shares .
This price was set by the accused themselves .
The company had appointed a CE@@ O and agents in Rajasthan , Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra .
The agents lu@@ red people to join the company with promises of very good returns .
Thereafter , some people invested between two to five lakh rupees .
The players in this team are setting new test match records everyday and now their reputation in one day tour@@ nam@@ ents is also increasing .
An excellent example of this was when a strong New Zealand team was crushed by Bangladesh , who had an insur@@ moun@@ table lead and won the on@@ e-@@ day series title .
With So@@ ha@@ g Gaz@@ i and Mus@@ her@@ fe Mur@@ ta@@ za &apos;s strong bow@@ ling Bangladesh defeated New Zealand in the second on@@ e-@@ day match by 40 runs and gained a insur@@ moun@@ table 2@@ -@@ 0 lead in the th@@ ree@@ -@@ match series .
This is Bangladesh &apos;s sixth consecutive win in on@@ e-@@ day matches against New Zealand .
Before this , New Zealand had lost the 2010 series to Bangladesh by 0@@ -@@ 4 .
Cha@@ sing a target of 24@@ 8 runs set by Bangladesh , the New Zealand team lost wick@@ ets at regular intervals . The team had pil@@ ed on 20@@ 7 runs in 4@@ 6.@@ 4 o@@ vers from the sp@@ in bow@@ ling of Ghaz@@ i ( 34 / 3 ) and the strong bow@@ ling of Mur@@ ta@@ za ( 43 / 3 ) .
New Zealand &apos;s R@@ oss T@@ ay@@ l@@ or made the highest score of 45 , while Co@@ re@@ y An@@ der@@ son sco@@ red 37 runs .
K@@ yle M@@ ills made 27 no@@ t-@@ out , while Na@@ than Mc@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ um contributed 25 runs , but many of the team &apos;s bat@@ smen could not convert the good start into a big in@@ nings score , so the team were defeated .
Ear@@ lier , the Bangladesh team was all out for 24@@ 7 runs after 49 o@@ vers in spite of Tam@@ im Iq@@ bal &apos;s ( 58 ) half century .
An@@ der@@ son and James N@@ is@@ ham took eight wick@@ ets between them .
An@@ der@@ son took 4 wick@@ ets for 40 runs , while N@@ is@@ ham claimed 4 wick@@ ets for 53 runs .
Tam@@ im became Bangladesh &apos;s highest run sco@@ rer in one day cricket .
Le@@ aving Shak@@ ib -@@ ul@@ -@@ Has@@ an behind , Tam@@ im sco@@ red 3,@@ 7@@ 02 runs in 12@@ 4 matches .
The third and final match of the series will be played on Sunday at Fat@@ ul@@ lah .
The bi@@ ke was found abandoned near the forests of Pip@@ ch@@ o .
The police have taken the bi@@ ke into custody .
The bi@@ ke belonged to J@@ R@@ PO post@@ man Ch@@ hot@@ i Me@@ hta .
The G@@ ate City Hall Cir@@ cle Office , that ear@@ ns crores of rupees every day for the Punjab State Power Corporation , is h@@ oused in an old ruin of a building .
All the employees are forced to work in fear of accidents .
Pla@@ ster falling from the ceiling everyday has caused pan@@ ic among the staff .
Buil@@ t in 19@@ 13 , this Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ -@@ era building was the Municipal Corporation &apos;s first office .
In 1995 the building was handed over to the Power Board .
The department just did some painting by way of repairs .
The building has deteri@@ or@@ ated to the extent that employees are afraid of working in it .
The building &apos;s condition is so poor that often pl@@ aster falls from the ceiling .
In the past month , pl@@ aster has fallen from the ceiling in four rooms .
Because of this a female employee was injured .
The J@@ E and Revenue accoun@@ tant nar@@ row@@ ly escaped injury in this accident .
Currently nearly four hundred employees work in the building .
These include the SE along with 5 Ex@@ .@@ En@@ s. , 12 S@@ DO@@ s , 20 J@@ uni@@ or Engine@@ ers , 1@@ 30 Cl@@ er@@ ical staff , 200 Technical Wor@@ kers and 20 other staff members .
Even though the situation is so bad , the Power@@ C@@ om top officials have taken no steps to secure their safety so far .
Three rooms allotted to the J@@ E@@ s , for sco@@ oter and cycle par@@ king , and two rooms on the upper floor of the building have complete collap@@ sed .
The state of the building can easily be assessed by these facts .
At the state women &apos;s sport cham@@ pion@@ ships Ro@@ ht@@ ak took first place in Kab@@ b@@ adi .
J@@ aj@@ j@@ har and H@@ is@@ sar came second and third respectively in Kab@@ add@@ i .
Similarly , in bas@@ ket@@ ball Son@@ ip@@ at was first , Ro@@ ht@@ ak second , and Kur@@ uk@@ sh@@ et@@ ra took third place .
In the vol@@ ley ball competition J@@ aj@@ j@@ har came first , Mah@@ end@@ rag@@ ar@@ h was second and Kar@@ nal were in third place .
In the team event g@@ ym@@ n@@ astic competition Amb@@ ala Team came first , the Ro@@ ht@@ ak team second and the B@@ hi@@ w@@ ani team came in third place .
In we@@ ight@@ li@@ fting the Son@@ ip@@ at team came first , the B@@ hi@@ w@@ ani team came second and the Ro@@ ht@@ ak team came in third place .
Similarly , the B@@ hi@@ w@@ ani team was first , the Ro@@ ht@@ ak team second and the H@@ is@@ sar team third in ath@@ le@@ tics .
On the other hand , at the closing ceremony while addressing the players and others present , the AD@@ C R@@ .@@ C. B@@ id@@ han said that the players should continue to practice hard with discipline so that they could become great players and bring glory to the country and state .
Em@@ pow@@ ering women at the state level of women &apos;s sports has prov@@ en to be especially effective .
The state level women &apos;s spor@@ ting competition began on October 29@@ th in Ro@@ ht@@ ak , at the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Compl@@ ex and ended on October 31st .
The AD@@ C said that the players will have to demon@@ strate their skills and exercise discipline to strengthen their abilities with hard work . Only then could they prove their met@@ tle in the future and bring glory to the country and their states .
Ar@@ ri@@ ving in Pune to inaugurate a section of the De@@ en@@ anath Mang@@ esh@@ kar Hospital , the BJP prime min@@ ist@@ erial candidate , Narendra Mo@@ di , while addressing an election r@@ ally on Friday , strongly attacked Congress .
On this occasion Mo@@ di said , &quot; In several states and in the Centre , coal@@ ition governments were formed at one time , Congress , Commun@@ ists and BJP also formed a coal@@ ition government .
You have seen the rule of many parties .
I call upon the Political pun@@ d@@ its and econom@@ ists .
Set a few parameters in the country .
Which party did what .
If the compar@@ ative results would come out , the question of whether the BJP government should rule or not would not arise in the country .
Whenever and wherever the BJP government was formed they tried to meet the people &apos;s aspirations .
This country is witness to the fact that during the governments led by At@@ al Bi@@ hari Vajpayee and Mor@@ ar@@ ji Desai inflation was low .
The poor man ate twice a day .
But when the government was formed by Congress or its supporters then the poor man could not get enough food .
Not one Congress leader , not one leader of the U@@ PA , can tell us what they have done in nine and a half years .
Our country &apos;s media also cannot talk to them .
Congress has become ego@@ is@@ tical .
They do not answer to the media .
In the Lok@@ sabha elections you answer to the public .
Att@@ acking the Congress leader , Kap@@ il Si@@ bal , Mo@@ di said , &quot; Every day Mo@@ di is being asked questions . In 2014 , if the public elect the BJP , then it will publish a record of its work for the public every year .
In a democracy a servant , not a ruler , should be sitting in Delhi .
There can be no lord in Delhi , but there should be a servant there .
The friends of Congress released bal@@ lo@@ ons every day .
The friends of Congress , we gave you a test just 10 months ago .
It is the public that will make you sit your examination in Democracy .
Google , Sam@@ sung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed over Nor@@ te@@ l pat@@ ents
The group that ow@@ ns thousands of former Nor@@ te@@ l pat@@ ents filed a bar@@ rage of patent law@@ su@@ its on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it out@@ bid in the Nor@@ te@@ l bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy auction .
R@@ oc@@ k@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ tium that bought the Nor@@ te@@ l pat@@ ents for $ 4@@ .5 billion , su@@ ed Sam@@ sung Electronics Co Ltd , HT@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for patent in@@ fr@@ ing@@ ement in U@@ .@@ S. District Court in Tex@@ as .
R@@ oc@@ k@@ star is jointly owned by Ap@@ ple , Microsoft , Bl@@ ack@@ berry , E@@ ric@@ s@@ son and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of in@@ fr@@ inging seven pat@@ ents .
The pat@@ ents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertis@@ ing , the law@@ suit said , which is the core of Google &apos;s search business .
Rep@@ resent@@ atives for Sam@@ sung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , HT@@ C and R@@ oc@@ k@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Sam@@ sung , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and HT@@ C all manufacture ph@@ ones that operate on Google &apos;s An@@ dro@@ id operating system , which compet@@ es fi@@ erc@@ ely with Ap@@ ple and Microsoft mobile products .
In 2011 Google placed an initial $ 9@@ 00 million bid for Nor@@ te@@ l &apos;s pat@@ ents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
After losing out to R@@ oc@@ k@@ star on the Nor@@ te@@ l pat@@ ents , Google went on to acquire Mot@@ or@@ ola M@@ ob@@ ility for $ 12@@ .5 billion , a deal driven partly by Mot@@ or@@ ola &apos;s library of pat@@ ents .
&quot; Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the pat@@ ent@@ s-@@ in-@@ suit at auction , Google has in@@ fr@@ inged and continues to in@@ fr@@ inge , &quot; the law@@ suit said .
R@@ oc@@ k@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google &apos;s patent in@@ fr@@ ing@@ ement is will@@ ful , according to the complaint .
Egypt sw@@ ears in first freely elected president
Mo@@ ha@@ med Mor@@ si takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is un@@ likely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egypt .
IS@@ LA@@ M@@ IST Mo@@ ha@@ med Mor@@ si promised a &quot; new Egypt &quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succ@@ eeding Hos@@ ni M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak who was ou@@ sted 16 months ago .
At his inaug@@ uration before the Supreme Constitu@@ tional Court , Mor@@ si also became the Arab world &apos;s first freely elected Islam@@ ist president and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy some 60 years ago .
He took the oath before the court &apos;s 18 black@@ -@@ ro@@ bed judges in its Nil@@ e-@@ side seat built to resem@@ ble an ancient Egyptian temple .
&quot; We asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , &quot; Mor@@ si said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0@@ -@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old US@@ -@@ trained engine@@ er from the Muslim Bro@@ therhood , a fundam@@ ent@@ alist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an out@@ law@@ ed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targ@@ eted by successive governments .
Hun@@ dreds of soldiers and polic@@ emen guarded the building as Mor@@ si arrived shor@@ tly after 11@@ am local time in a small mot@@ or@@ cade .
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presid@@ ential pom@@ p of the M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak years , traffic was only bri@@ efly hal@@ ted to allow his mot@@ or@@ cade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
D@@ er@@ ided as the Bro@@ therhood &apos;s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic &quot; spare ty@@ re , &quot; his personal prestige has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 u@@ prising against the authorit@@ arian M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak .
&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Mor@@ si , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the woo@@ d@@ -@@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the oath of office .
Mor@@ si later travelled to C@@ air@@ o University where he was to make his inaug@@ uration address .
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention .
Mil@@ itary ruler Field Mar@@ sha@@ l Hus@@ se@@ in Tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was in attendance .
His arrival was greeted with ch@@ ants of , &quot; The army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lecture room .
Establ@@ ished in 1908 as a bas@@ tion of secular education , C@@ air@@ o University later became a str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of Islam@@ ist student groups in the 197@@ 0s .
Mor@@ si took a symbolic oath on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Squ@@ are , bir@@ th@@ place of the u@@ prising that ended M@@ ub@@ ar@@ ak &apos;s authorit@@ arian rule last year , and v@@ owed to rec@@ la@@ im presid@@ ential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ou@@ sted leader .
But by agree@@ ing to take the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is custom@@ ary , he is b@@ owing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the cont@@ est for power will continue .
Mor@@ si &apos;s speech in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Squ@@ are was filled with dramatic popul@@ ist gest@@ ures .

Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry unexpectedly acknowledged that in the US sp@@ ying has gone too far , in some cases .
He also claimed that innocent people have been tor@@ tured under secret sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance programs .
Ker@@ ry &apos;s conf@@ ession came while addressing the Open Government Partnership &apos;s annual summ@@ it in London via a video link .
Ker@@ ry said , &quot; I assure you that innocent people were not being har@@ assed in this process &quot; .

Meanwhile , a key committee of the U@@ .@@ S. Congress has approved a bill to limit the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency &#91; N@@ SA &#93; .
The aim of this is to make monitoring more transparent and to get back the trust of the people which has been lost following the dis@@ closure of large scale phone tap@@ ping .
This move by the Sen@@ ate was welcomed by six U@@ .@@ S. companies including Google and Yahoo .
The data centres in these companies have also been ha@@ c@@ ked by the N@@ SA .
On Friday the select committee of the Sen@@ ate passed a bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance Act ( F@@ IS@@ A ) by 11 votes to 4 .
Many restrictions , including an ou@@ tri@@ ght ban on phone tap@@ ping , have been proposed in this bill , under the American Pat@@ ri@@ ot Act .
Deli@@ ber@@ ate , un@@ authorized collection and use of data under F@@ IS@@ A will be treated as a criminal offence and will be pun@@ ishable by up to ten years in prison .
Once both Congress , the House of Rep@@ resent@@ atives and the Sen@@ ate pass the bill , it will become law .
The Committee Chairman and Sen@@ ator , Di@@ ane F@@ esti@@ n , said that the N@@ SA &apos;s program of recording phone calls is within the law , and believed it had contributed significantly to the country &apos;s security .
However , there should be more transparency .
Not only that , the protection of personal priv@@ acy should also be kept in mind .
Meanwhile , Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , Ap@@ ple , A@@ OL and Facebook , disturbed by the revelation of the N@@ SA &apos;s Internet sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance program , have supported this bill .
In letters written to the sen@@ ators all these companies have said that the sen@@ ators &apos; proposal to re@@ strict the N@@ SA &apos;s large scale phone tap@@ ping is welcomed by them .
It is note@@ worthy that the documents released by the former CI@@ A employee Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den made the actions of the N@@ SA public .
The N@@ SA &apos;s monitoring of the phone conver@@ sations of the presid@@ ents of 35 countries , including Germany and France , had caused a huge upro@@ ar in the international community .

Th@@ ought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
F@@ light Centre seem to be buc@@ king the trend .
The company has up@@ graded its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from holid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel company now expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 3@@ 25 million and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared with the $ 30@@ 5 million to $ 3@@ 15 million it previously forecast .
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.@@ 4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
Manag@@ ing director G@@ raham Tur@@ ner said F@@ light Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-@@ business travel .
&quot; Y@@ ear@@ -@@ to-@@ date , our 10 countries are prof@@ itable and several are on track for record ful@@ l@@ -@@ year earnings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators .
In Australia the leis@@ ure business reb@@ ounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market .
Similarly in the UK , F@@ light Centre &apos;s leis@@ ure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
Its US business had recovered its losses during its seas@@ on@@ ally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit .
F@@ light Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
In a recent media report it was said that the N@@ SA ha@@ c@@ ked into the data centres of Yahoo and Google for sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance .
The Washington Post exposed this based on the documents collected by former N@@ SA contrac@@ tor , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
According to the report , the N@@ SA program was called Mus@@ cular , and was run together with their British counter@@ part - G@@ CH@@ Q .
Both agencies st@@ ole data passing through the vast network of fibre op@@ tic c@@ ables laid by Yahoo and Google .
On January 9th , 2013 the Washington Post reported , quot@@ ing a top secret document , that more than 18 million documents were stol@@ en within just 3 days from the beginning of the program .
These included email , text , audio and video messages .
According to the Washington Post the program was run out of the U@@ .@@ S. and an an@@ onymous telecommun@@ ications provider helped the N@@ SA to access this information .
According to the newspaper it was much easier for the N@@ SA to run the program outside the U@@ .@@ S. because in the U@@ .@@ S. such campa@@ igns must have court orders .
During a press conference in Washington the N@@ SA Chief , General Ke@@ ith Alexander , denied these allegations saying , &quot; As far as I know , this never happened .
The N@@ SA has always gathered its information only within the framework of the law &quot; .
The N@@ SA recently became a target after sp@@ ying on the German Chancell@@ or .
The United Nations said on W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day that the U@@ .@@ S. government has issued ass@@ ur@@ ances that communications are not being mon@@ it@@ ored .
The U@@ .@@ S. also said that the United Nations communication system is not being mon@@ it@@ ored .
The BJP leader and prime min@@ ist@@ erial candidate for Gujarat , Chief Minister Narendra Mo@@ di &apos;s most trusted a@@ ide , Am@@ it Shah &apos;s brother arrived on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day afternoon in G@@ aya with his family .
District President Jain@@ endra Kumar , National Con@@ ven@@ er of Non@@ -@@ conventional Energy S@@ ources , K@@ ris@@ han Kumar Singh , An@@ il Singh an M@@ L@@ A of H@@ is@@ ua from Naw@@ ada , An@@ il Swami , Sh@@ y@@ ama Singh , Muk@@ esh Kumar along with many other leaders were at Mr. Shah &apos;s private function .
District President Mr. Kumar said Mr. Shah , along with his family , went to worship and pray to Shak@@ ti@@ pe@@ eth &apos;s mother at the Kam@@ ak@@ hya temple in Assam and arrived at G@@ aya Airport on a special plane .
Then they directly went to pay obe@@ isance at the feet of the Shak@@ ti@@ pe@@ eth mother , Mang@@ ala G@@ aur@@ i .
After the worship and prayer at the Vishn@@ up@@ ad temple he went back on a special plane .
District President Mr. Kumar said that , for security reasons , Mr. Shah &apos;s program had not been made public .
Schools urged to focus more on ma@@ ths , sp@@ elling and grammar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shak@@ es@@ pe@@ are play , a 19th century novel , Rom@@ antic poetry and contemporary British fic@@ tion from 19@@ 14 onwards .
The ex@@ am will also feature &quot; unseen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
A combined English literature and language course will be scr@@ apped .
From 2015 , pupils will be required to take a stand@@ alone G@@ CS@@ E in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
The Department for Education is due to release the new syl@@ lab@@ uses in English and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical over@@ ha@@ ul .
It will make changes in other core subjects next year .
In a separate move , Of@@ qu@@ al , the exam@@ s regul@@ ator , will un@@ veil a sha@@ k@@ e-@@ up of the structure of G@@ C@@ SEs , with a new grading system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
Speaking in the summer , Michael Go@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insist@@ ing G@@ C@@ SEs would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more ri@@ gor@@ ous . &quot;
Studies show that English schools dev@@ ote less time to ma@@ ths - 11@@ 6 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
By comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and pupils do around 13@@ 8 hours in Singapore .
While there will be no formal requirement to dev@@ ote more of the tim@@ et@@ able to ma@@ ths , Co@@ al@@ ition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths G@@ CS@@ E - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in le@@ ague tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
The syl@@ lab@@ us will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathematics .
The Supreme Court has refused to ban media reporting .
The Supreme Court said that they cannot ask the media to stop reporting information collected from the police or any other source .
As@@ aram &apos;s lawyer said that As@@ aram was being made out to be a kind of D@@ rac@@ ula in this case .
In this case , the guidelines for reporting are in place but they are not being followed .
The Supreme Court said that there are several other options that could be used .
As@@ aram &apos;s lawyer said that there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels in the country , but specifically there were having problems with two channels .
These people were dam@@ aging his image and are guilty of on@@ e-@@ sided reporting .
As@@ aram &apos;s rights should be protected in this case .
The Court refused to stop the media from reporting , but told As@@ aram &apos;s lawyer that they have other legal options which they may make use of .
P@@ aw@@ an B@@ ans@@ al att@@ c@@ ked by the opposition &apos;s questions on R@@ ail G@@ ate , shoc@@ ked the opposition by saying that he had not so much as looked at a women in the past 15 years .
After this everyone one was st@@ un@@ ned and won@@ dered where the issue of a woman had come from .
Maybe , B@@ ans@@ al was hin@@ ting at the family life of a Senior BJP leader and legisl@@ ator .
Then , changing the subject , B@@ ans@@ al told the re@@ porters that in the last parliamentary elections the BJP had sent a women after him and con@@ sp@@ ired to lo@@ dge a complaint against him , but that they had failed .
Addres@@ sing the re@@ porters B@@ ans@@ al said that the C@@ BI had inter@@ rog@@ ated him in the R@@ ail Cor@@ rup@@ tion case .
If he has called as a witness then it must only have been after a complete investigation .
B@@ ans@@ al said that , in the bo@@ oth in question , he had only delivered a letter for a needy person .
If that is a crime , he would always commit the crime .
He said that it was not the corporation &apos;s constitutional right to raise the issue in the House , but he himself told the opposition to do so .
He said that as far as the developmental activities were concerned the opposition would be provided with a list of all the developmental activities of the last 15 years .
In Chandigarh they cannot imagine the way in which the development is taking place or will take place .
Gre@@ etings were exchanged between the two in a cabinet meeting .
After the meeting , Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the meditation camp for the counter attack on Narendra Mo@@ di .
He also comm@@ ented on his speech , saying that he didn &apos;@@ t have any second thoughts in his mind .
He wanted the party to become strong .
New challenges will be faced strongly .
The expression on the Chief Minister &apos;s face showed that he had taken Singh &apos;s speech in a positive way .
It should be noted that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the ac@@ tivi@@ sts in the meditation camp and to protect them from the alleged har@@ assment by officials .
However , he had also said that to assert his point he was also prepared for the dissolution of the cabinet .
Though , after seeing the opinions arising from the meditation camp there was a chance that the case for putting ac@@ tivi@@ sts into government posts will also be re@@ considered .
At the camp the state J@@ D@@ U president , V@@ ash@@ ish@@ t Narayan Singh , had said that the nomin@@ ations of the ac@@ tivi@@ sts in the 20@@ -@@ point committee would be announced soon .
He also indicated that the list was almost ready .
Now the news is coming that Chief Minister , Ni@@ tish Kumar , will have a look at the list at his level .
He will also examine whether or not the opinion of the leg@@ islat@@ ors and Members of Parliament was taken into account when generating the list .
If need be the list will be revised on a large scale to give places to older and more committed ac@@ tivi@@ sts .
The common complaint of the leg@@ islat@@ ors and Members of Parliament is that their opinion was not considered while generating the list .
Most of the people who have come from other parties are on the list but a significant number of workers , active since the Sam@@ ata Party period , have been left off .
Some people are born with a silver spo@@ on in their mouths , while others create a perfect life by their hard work and people take inspiration from them .
One of the such person@@ alities is the late Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai Am@@ ban@@ i .
The third son of H@@ ir@@ ach@@ and Go@@ var@@ ad@@ hand@@ as Am@@ ban@@ i , who worked as a teacher in a school in Cor@@ av@@ ada , a small village in Gujarat , Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai Am@@ ban@@ i was born on December 28@@ th , 1932 .
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai was the third of five brothers and sisters .
The five children were Raman@@ ik@@ al@@ ala , Nat@@ war Lal , Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai and two sisters , Tr@@ il@@ o@@ ch@@ ana and Jas@@ um@@ ati .
Due to financial constra@@ ints Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai had to drop out after high school .
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai started helping in the house fin@@ anci@@ ally from childhood .
At that time he set up a st@@ all selling Bha@@ ji@@ yas near Gir@@ n@@ ar . The income from the st@@ all was dependent on the number of tourists going there .
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai &apos;s first job was in 1949 at the age of 17 when he arrived on a ship called C@@ ab@@ ota in the city of Ad@@ en , in the Y@@ emen .
His elder brother , Ran@@ ik@@ l@@ ala , had made all the arrangements for him there , so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad .
But Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai had something else in mind .
So he returned home in 1954 .
By 1955 , he had landed in Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket , to try his luck .
And from here he started his travel business .
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai never looked back .
His name became known not only in the country , but also abroad .
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai Am@@ ban@@ i b@@ ade fa@@ re@@ well to the world on July 6th , 2002 .
When he died he had Rs 6@@ 2,@@ 000 crores .
Currently his sons , Muk@@ esh Am@@ ban@@ i and An@@ il Am@@ ban@@ i , are looking after his empire .
Like their father , today these two brothers are at the international level of business@@ men .
Who has not heard of the Am@@ ban@@ i family today ?
Dh@@ ir@@ ub@@ hai , Ko@@ kil@@ ab@@ en , their two sons , Muk@@ esh and An@@ il Am@@ ban@@ i , and their wives N@@ ita Am@@ ban@@ i and T@@ ina Am@@ ban@@ i .

The sacrifice of Sha@@ heed Kes@@ ari was remembered and a cultural program , including patriotic pres@@ ent@@ ations , was performed .
The program was organised on Friday at Gandhi park on behalf of the committee .
Here May@@ or Vin@@ od Cha@@ mol@@ i , with the office bear@@ ers of the committee , laid a w@@ re@@ ath at the stat@@ ue of the Sha@@ heed Kes@@ ari Chand .
After that a cultural program was organised at the Hindi Bhavan , where the former S@@ P state President Vin@@ od Bad@@ th@@ wal was present . Principal guest and former legisl@@ ator Mun@@ na Singh Cha@@ u@@ han was also present as a special guest .
In this program Su@@ kh K@@ ala Man@@ ch , Ja@@ un@@ sa@@ ar presented &apos; Kes@@ ari ter@@ i ya@@ ad me@@ in k@@ ash@@ i b@@ hu@@ laun@@ i , Ji@@ y@@ ende@@ i ter@@ i y@@ add@@ on bir@@ a k@@ ash@@ i mit@@ a@@ uni &apos; , &apos; Ve@@ er k@@ es@@ ari chand ji ki har@@ ut &apos; , Ja@@ un@@ sa@@ ar ke ar@@ ad@@ hya dev ma@@ has@@ u dev@@ ata ki v@@ and@@ ana ; etc . Cultural programs were presented .

The speak@@ ers urged those present in the program to become strong@@ -@@ willed and patriotic , like Sha@@ heed Kes@@ ari .
The Chairman of the Committee Jay@@ av@@ ir Singh Cha@@ u@@ han , Mat@@ bar Singh Cha@@ u@@ han , Su@@ resh Tom@@ ar , Rav@@ indra B@@ hand@@ ari , Am@@ it Joshi , Mi@@ ja@@ an Rai , Sun@@ il Dutt Sharma were present at the event .
K@@ illing mos@@ qu@@ it@@ oes to prevent diseases like den@@ gue , mal@@ aria and fil@@ ari@@ asis is going to be expensive .
The state government is proceeding to raise the tax on mos@@ qui@@ to killing rep@@ ell@@ ents , mat@@ s and liqu@@ ids by up to three times .
The proposal to increase tax will be presented to the cabinet soon .
The government is strug@@ gling with a financial crisis these days and is searching for ways to do everything possible to increase revenue .
It is note@@ worthy that , to improve the financial health of the government , a resource committee has been formed under the chair@@ manship of Urban Development Minister , Mo@@ ha@@ med Az@@ am Khan .
According to sources , in a recently held resource committee meeting many proposals to increase the tax were rejected if the general public would be directly affected .
However , the committee has given the green flag to increase the taxes on mos@@ qui@@ to rep@@ ell@@ ents , co@@ ils , mat@@ s and liqu@@ ids .
A proposal to tri@@ ple the taxes has been put forward .
Currently they carry 4 % V@@ AT plus an additional 1 % tax .
Now a 12@@ .5 % V@@ AT plus a 1.5 % additional tax on these items is proposed .
The government is likely to generate additional revenue of around Rs 14 crore in this way .
A proposal for a tax hi@@ ke on the per@@ si@@ mm@@ on leaf was rejected : In fact , to increase the revenue income the commercial tax department was in favour of increasing the tax on the per@@ si@@ mm@@ on leaf by 14 % , but the Financial Resources Committee has rejected that proposal .
The committee believes that per@@ si@@ mm@@ on leaf is used to make bid@@ is that the low@@ er@@ -@@ class people smoke .
Similarly , the committee rejected the proposal to increase taxes on transmission wi@@ res , etc . , and electrical goods that would have pushed up the cost of electricity and would have a direct impact on the general public .
The committee also rejected the proposal for the application of a green tax on the renew@@ al of commercial vehicles .
On Friday Congress leader Cha@@ d@@ v@@ ir H@@ oo@@ da gave a speech to the inhabitants of Sector 2 and Mah@@ esh@@ pur village
During this speech he invited the people to join the r@@ ally and determined who was responsible for what .
Cha@@ d@@ v@@ ir also determined the duties of the ac@@ tivi@@ sts .
Cha@@ d@@ v@@ ir H@@ oo@@ da said that the Haryana Chief Minister , Bh@@ up@@ inder Singh H@@ oo@@ da , has spent bil@@ lions of rupees in the district .
In the last four years Haryana Chief Minister Bh@@ up@@ inder Singh H@@ oo@@ da has completed development work worth Rs 15 crore in Bar@@ wala and has blocked panc@@ hay@@ ats .
Cha@@ d@@ v@@ ir H@@ oo@@ da said that because of the appeal of the Chief Minister ac@@ tivi@@ sts are very excited about this r@@ ally and this r@@ ally will be the biggest amongst all the r@@ allies so far and this will put Haryana politics on the map in the entire country .
Cha@@ d@@ v@@ ir said that , based on the popularity gained by the Chief Minister by the way of land@@ mark decisions and for activities for the people &apos;s welfare , the public would also elect H@@ oo@@ da for the third time .
Diwali , the festival of wealth , happiness and prosperity begins on Friday with Dhan@@ ter@@ as .
Prepar@@ ations at home and in the markets have reached the final stage .
To double the enjoyment of the city &apos;s inhabitants the main market Bap@@ u Market , Ash@@ win@@ i Market , Sar@@ af@@ a Market , Bad@@ b@@ hu@@ ja Valley , Sindhi Market , etc. have put up extensive decor@@ ations .
Sh@@ op@@ keepers have made special prepar@@ ations in their shops for the convenience of their customers .
The f@@ estive atmosphere has resulted in large crow@@ ds in the major markets several times during the day .
There is a competition amongst the merchant uni@@ ons for the best decor@@ ations during Diwali .
The main markets sectors 4 , 5 , 6 and sector 14 of the sub@@ urban areas have been decorated .
Sh@@ op@@ ping continued in these markets on the eve of Dhan@@ ter@@ as too .
Sal@@ es of materials related to worship , lamps and lighting etc. were especially strong on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Jag@@ aran Bureau , Sh@@ rin@@ agar : The police have alleg@@ edly removed the security of the former Minister G@@ hu@@ lam Has@@ an Khan who joined Congress from the People Democratic Party .
Khan blamed the government , saying that his security has been removed for political reasons .
It may be recalled that in the year 2002 G@@ hu@@ lam Has@@ an Khan , who won the 2002 elections from Sh@@ op@@ ian on a P@@ DP ticket , was included in the cabinet , while Mu@@ f@@ ti Mo@@ ha@@ med S@@ ay@@ eed was a Chief Minister .
G@@ hu@@ lam H@@ ass@@ an Khan said he has had protection since 1996 .
I live in Sh@@ op@@ ian , which is believed to be a str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of terrorists .
A CR@@ P@@ F security team under the leadership of a sub-@@ inspec@@ tor is st@@ a@@ tioned at my house .
I have also bo@@ dy@@ guards , but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
As when the security team was leaving from my house I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District Super@@ int@@ endent .
But instead of re@@ storing security they just said that they would investi@@ gate the matter .
However , in this regard , when the Kashmir I@@ GP , Abdul G@@ ani Me@@ er , was cont@@ acted he denied any knowledge of the issue and said that it was a sensitive issue .
I should check it out myself . After all , how can the protection of a former minister and senior political leader be removed ?
The State Congress Chief , Prof. Saf@@ ud@@ in So@@ z , said that as far as he knew nothing of this kind had ever happened before .
If Has@@ an Khan &apos;s security has been com@@ promised , then it is a very serious matter .
I am in Jammu now and will be coming to Kashmir in a day or two .
I will discuss this issue with the authorities concerned .
According to the report , the U@@ PA government has spent Rs 8@@ .5 crore to adver@@ tise the anniversary of the birth of Sardar Patel over the last four years .
But , contrary to the claims by Mo@@ di during the N@@ DA government ( between 1994 and 2004 ) , while At@@ al Bi@@ hari Vajpayee was the PM there was a time for 2 consecutive years ( 200@@ 1-@@ 2002 ) when not a single advertis@@ ement for Sardar Patel was published by the Government .
On Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day in K@@ ev@@ a@@ dia , Gujarat laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel &apos;s 182 meter high stat@@ ue , &apos; the Stat@@ ue of Un@@ ity &apos; , Mo@@ di said , &quot; Ear@@ lier , there was no advertis@@ ing for the anniversary of Sardar Patel .
While the DA@@ V@@ P &apos;s records show that in 200@@ 9@@ -@@ 10 up to 3 million , in 201@@ 0@@ -@@ 11 to Rs 4.@@ 10 crore , in 201@@ 1-@@ 12 and Rs 2.@@ 7 crore and in 201@@ 2@@ -@@ 13 to Rs 1.@@ 4 crore U@@ PA had been spent on advertis@@ ing for Sardar Patel .
When the Union Information and Broad@@ casting Minister , Man@@ ish Te@@ wari , was asked about Mo@@ di &apos;s claims he said that what the BJP &apos;s PM candidate said was not based on the facts .
In 2008 the U@@ PA did not publish any ads in the name of Patel .
Ti@@ wari said that it was because of the economic down@@ turn in that year .
The amounts spent on promoting Sardar Patel are far less than the amount spent on the birth and death anni@@ vers@@ aries of the Nehru - Gandhi family members .
DA@@ V@@ P has spent 33 crores on the birth and death anni@@ vers@@ aries , 21 crores for former PM Rajiv Gandhi , 14@@ .5 crores for Indira Gandhi and R@@ s@@ .@@ 9.@@ 38 crores for Jawaharlal Nehru , on print advertis@@ ing .
When Man@@ ish Ti@@ wari was asked about the difference , he said , &quot; it should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertis@@ ing .
Because the price of advertis@@ ing depends on several things , such as the size or frequency of the advertis@@ ement for that year .
The fact is that it shows our dedication without understanding that the people opposed to this are busy taking care of the legacy of a great leader .
Today he will meet the families of the people who died in Patna last Sunday .
As it is Narendra Mo@@ di &apos;s second visit to Patna just a week after the bla@@ sts the security has been tigh@@ tened .
The police have examined the route of Mo@@ di &apos;s visit and the sites of the meeting thoroughly .
Police will keep an eye on the people coming to the meetings .
The Gujarat police force , the N@@ S@@ G@@ I@@ B and the State police force will take care of security .
Mo@@ di &apos;s prot@@ ective shi@@ eld will be tigh@@ tened .
Meanwhile , questions are being raised about the ur@@ n procession undertaken by the BJP , carrying the ashes of the people who died in the bla@@ sts .
Chief Minister Ni@@ tish Kumar has accused the BJP of spo@@ iling the atmosphere .
Tre@@ k@@ king through mud , rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cam@@ ero@@ on
B@@ wel@@ le and his team spend almost every week@@ end seeing hundreds of patients
There aren &apos;@@ t many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,@@ 000 people
C@@ ast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 C@@ N@@ N Her@@ oes of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Her@@ oes , to be C@@ N@@ N H@@ ero of the Year .
That person will receive $ 25@@ 0,@@ 000 to continue their extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness , trav@@ eling to hospitals that w@@ er@@ en &apos;@@ t equipped to help him .
Jam@@ ef B@@ wel@@ le was injured in a 1981 car accident near Ya@@ oun@@ de , Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos;s capital .
He suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a h@@ emat@@ oma that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; There were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Cam@@ ero@@ on , &quot; Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le said .
We would have taken him out of Cam@@ ero@@ on if we had the money .
Instead , B@@ wel@@ le spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
You can leave home at 5 a@@ .@@ m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
Some people can die because they are waiting .
The situation has@@ n &apos;@@ t changed much since B@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5,@@ 000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
For comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people .
And even if they could see a phys@@ ician , many Cam@@ ero@@ on@@ ians couldn &apos;@@ t afford it .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly th@@ ree@@ -@@ quarters of the country &apos;s health@@ -@@ care spending is private .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
And with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , B@@ wel@@ le was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Geor@@ ges B@@ wel@@ le and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free sur@@ g@@ eries in the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a vas@@ cular sur@@ geon in Ya@@ oun@@ de &apos;s Central Hospital .
And he started a non@@ profit , AS@@ CO@@ VI@@ ME , that trav@@ els into rural areas on week@@ ends to provide free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 3@@ 2,@@ 000 people .
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , tie medical supplies to the ro@@ ofs and travel across rough ter@@ rain to visit villages in need .
Their luck doesn &apos;@@ t always hold out .
They &apos;@@ ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
But when they arrive , they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome : a fe@@ ast , singing and dancing , and the best accommod@@ ations the community can offer .
In these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ wel@@ le -@@ - with his big smile and bound@@ less energy -@@ - is more than happy to join in the fun .
The next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; We are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
They are coming from 60 kilomet@@ ers around the village , and they &apos;@@ re coming on foot .
Each of these week@@ end clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care .
Many people are treated for mal@@ aria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , parasites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , a pair of don@@ ated ey@@ eg@@ l@@ asses or free birth certificates -@@ - documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many im@@ pover@@ ished families simply can &apos;@@ t afford .
In the ev@@ enings , the team will do simple sur@@ g@@ eries with local anes@@ the@@ sia .
Oper@@ ations are usually done in a school@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
With the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and san@@ iti@@ zing equipment , B@@ wel@@ le and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
It &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village mus@@ icians usually help keep the team motiv@@ ated .
&quot; They are beating dr@@ ums all night to keep us awake and continue our work , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
On Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
The group -@@ - a mix of Cam@@ ero@@ on@@ ian doctors and foreign medical students -@@ - has performed 700 free sur@@ g@@ eries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
One man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he &apos;@@ d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; This will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
In addition to holding these week@@ end clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ geon , B@@ wel@@ le also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around Ya@@ oun@@ de .
It &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private don@@ ations .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m not sure when he sle@@ eps , &quot; said K@@ ati@@ e O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a second@@ -@@ year medical student from D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ p@@ hia and volunte@@ er with B@@ wel@@ le &apos;s group .
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campa@@ igns .
For medical and nursing students such as O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ wel@@ le on his missions , it &apos;s a hand@@ s-@@ on opportunity they &apos;@@ d never get at home .
&quot; We &apos;@@ ve been able to sc@@ rub in on sur@@ g@@ eries where we help b@@ lot blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ wel@@ le , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
That &apos;s not something you &apos;@@ d ever get to do in America as a second@@ -@@ year medical student .
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cam@@ ero@@ on , often arri@@ ving with don@@ ated medical supplies .
But once they arrive in Ya@@ oun@@ de , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ wel@@ le .
&quot; He &apos;s a hero , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said .
He gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is everlasting .
For B@@ wel@@ le , the near@@ -@@ constant work@@ load isn &apos;@@ t a hardship .
Hel@@ ping others live hap@@ pi@@ er lives , ful@@ filling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; B@@ wel@@ le said .
And I think about my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
To make people laugh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why I &apos;@@ m doing this .
Check out the AS@@ CO@@ VI@@ ME website and see how to help .
You may not believe it but it is true .
Not only that , but the name of Mission road was changed to the name of the City Legisl@@ ator , Anj@@ ali Kumar .

While addressing a r@@ ally Mo@@ di said , &quot; If you listen to all the speeches given by all the leaders of Congress , then you will see that they never talk about what they have done . &quot;
He said , &quot; Congress has become so arrogant that does not answer media questions . &quot;
Man@@ mohan Singh is the Prime Minister and it is his government , yet they want Mo@@ di to respond .
An@@ sw@@ ering the public &apos;s questions is your duty .
Clear@@ ly , Mo@@ di was referring to Si@@ bal , who had told journ@@ alists in Delhi that Mo@@ di wants to create an environment where he is in control , where he gives his speeches and he does not talk to journ@@ alists in order to avoid their questions .
Si@@ bal challenged Mo@@ di to a face to face debate .
Mo@@ di said , &quot; I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014 , then we will submit a report each year to the public . &quot;
Congress has given the tic@@ kets to all his former leg@@ islat@@ ors .

Up@@ as@@ ane has been asked to handle the State office and also tour the State if required .
As the State President Ram@@ sev@@ ak Pa@@ ik@@ ara and Secretary Shiv@@ rat@@ an Sharma , along with many other officials , are cont@@ esting the elections , Secretary Ram@@ pr@@ at@@ ap is left to handle the organisation alone .
Because of this , Up@@ as@@ ane has been handed a great responsibility .
The North seat cont@@ est@@ ant , R@@ DA President Sun@@ il Son@@ i , has been given the responsible position of the Ra@@ ipur South S@@ eat election director .
Another cont@@ ender , Regional Municipal Corporation Chairman San@@ j@@ ay Sri@@ v@@ ast@@ ava , has been given a seat on the reception committee .

Obama &apos;s Health Care Wal@@ k Back
Am@@ id a fire@@ storm of criticism , President Obama yesterday walked back his of@@ t-@@ repeated , un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
With hundreds of thousands receiving canc@@ ellation notices from their providers , Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have s@@ lam@@ med the president in recent days for mis@@ leading the American public .
Y@@ esterday , Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original pledge .
&quot; For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in Boston .
Addres@@ sing what he called the &quot; fl@@ ur@@ ry in the news &quot; about the canc@@ el@@ lations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the mark@@ et@@ place .
Most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even che@@ aper than projected .
&quot; You &apos;@@ re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;@@ t meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act .
&quot; Let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , &quot; Se@@ beli@@ us said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .
Se@@ beli@@ us , who is over@@ seeing implementation of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act , said the launch of the online mark@@ et@@ place has gone &quot; mis@@ er@@ ably &quot; since October .
&quot; I am as fru@@ strated and angry as anyone , &quot; she said .
I am eager to earn your confidence back .
An ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated Se@@ beli@@ us uttered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an a@@ ide seated behind her at yesterday &apos;s House hearing following a cont@@ enti@@ ous exchange with Rep@@ . Bil@@ ly Long , R@@ -@@ M@@ o . , over whether she should be required to en@@ roll in Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
More than three hours into the hearing , Long repeatedly pressed Se@@ beli@@ us on why the &quot; archit@@ ect &quot; of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Care Act has not volun@@ tar@@ ily for@@ gone govern@@ ment@@ -@@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through H@@ eal@@ th@@ Care@@ .@@ go@@ v , which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of Americans .
It has been revealed that a ransom of two lakh rupees was demanded from the trader .
If no money was paid he was threatened and told his daughter would be kid@@ n@@ apped .

The cal@@ lers asked for two lakh rupees as ransom .
He was threatened that if the money was not paid Narendra would be killed or his daughter would be kid@@ n@@ apped .
Narendra did not take the threats seriously at first , but when the threats started to increase and his 12th . St@@ d. daughter was threatened he became worried .
The family members are frightened .
A complaint was lod@@ ged on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
No cl@@ ue to the identity of the criminals has yet been found .
Given the sever@@ ity of the case support from the cy@@ ber crime cell is being sought .
In addition , M@@ L@@ A Band@@ al has ordered the officials from the villages of Bha@@ gi@@ wander , Band@@ ar Patt@@ i , Lal@@ ena , J@@ j@@ al F@@ u@@ lo@@ k@@ hari G@@ at@@ wali and Mal@@ k@@ ana to meet the people personally and to solve their problems face to face .

Due to which the number of cases of viol@@ ations of the code of conduct are dec@@ lining .
After the implementation of the election code of conduct between October 4th to October 21st , 3@@ 13 cases were lod@@ ged against various political parties .
While only 31 cases were registered between October 22@@ nd and October 27@@ th .
With the implementation of the election code of conduct cases of its violation were also being reported .
Initi@@ ally there were many complaints , but gradually they are becoming fe@@ wer .
It is being said that , as no@@ -@@ one had full information about the code of conduct , the number of complaints registered against the political parties was rising .
As the election commission made the political parties aware of them and asked them to learn a lesson from the registered complaints the complaints have reduced .
Many parties were campa@@ ign@@ ing in an old fashioned manner because of a lack of information , but when action was taken against them they stopped doing that .
The political parties are learning about the election code of conduct and are also compl@@ ying with it .
Due to this the number of cases of code violation have declined .
A proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government on behalf of A@@ DA , which is soon going to be approved .
This historical city , surrounded on three sides by Gang@@ a-@@ Jam@@ una has no land left where A@@ DA can plan a big residential project .
So now they have decided to plan residential projects beyond J@@ hun@@ si in the east , F@@ af@@ am@@ au in the north , and beyond N@@ ain@@ i in the South .
To make the plan inclusive a meeting was held under the chair@@ manship of the District coll@@ ector , Raj@@ she@@ k@@ har .
A@@ DA has plans to include the villages of Ph@@ ul@@ pur , Sor@@ an@@ va , and Kur@@ ch@@ hun@@ a , with a population of two hundred citizens .
After being included in the A@@ DA boundary the Cha@@ ka and Bahadur blocks will be completed .
Half of the K@@ audi@@ har block will be brought within the A@@ DA boundary .
According to Amar@@ nath Up@@ adhy@@ aya , secretary of A@@ DA , a proposal concerning this matter has been sent to the government .
A@@ DA wants to bring the boundaries of these gr@@ amp@@ anc@@ hay@@ ants under its author@@ isation for planning , and will begin work on it soon .
If that happens , the price of buildings will decline in the city .
The availability of housing for the general public will be increased .
Soon residential palaces on the lines of Lucknow and No@@ ida will begin to be built in these new areas .
In the Government Medical College and Hospital ( G@@ MC@@ H ) , Sector 32 ENT department head , Prof. Arjun Das of the National Academy of Medical Sciences New Delhi , has been selected for the fel@@ low@@ ship .

According to the Director of the Institute , Principal Prof. A@@ tu@@ l Sach@@ dev@@ a , he is the second faculty member of the institute to have received the fel@@ low@@ ship .
The human population has exceeded 7 billion .
If the population continues to increase this way , the time will soon come when mu@@ stering a mor@@ sel for every hungry mouth would be very difficult .
According to experts , in the near future people will have no other option but to eat worms and insects .
According to reports , this year a group of students from Mc@@ G@@ ill University in Mon@@ tre@@ al received the H@@ ult Prize for an innovative project .
They were given the award for making protein fl@@ our from worms and insects .
A $ 1 million grant was awarded to them to make it possible for them to pursue their research and experiments .
In an interview with A@@ BC News on September 30th , the Group Chief Stud@@ ent Res@@ ear@@ cher , Mohammed Ash@@ or , said that his team will experiment with gras@@ shop@@ pers for food .
This report has an detailed description of edible worms and insects .
Finally , due to the Lok Sabha elections the Gujarat Chief Minister , Narendra Mo@@ di , expanded his cabinet on Friday to include 6 new ministers .

Apart from Jodhpur , As@@ aram is also a susp@@ ect in the case of the rap@@ e of a girl in Surat .

Here in India , As@@ aram is in jail and his devotees are slowly breaking away from him , but this is not at all the case in America .
In the New Jer@@ sey ash@@ ram even now the devotees continue to come as before and pray to As@@ aram .
John Ker@@ ry says US sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately &quot; in unprecedented admission
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the U@@ .@@ S &apos;s def@@ ensive st@@ ance on its sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . &quot;
The Secretary of State also admitted that he &apos;@@ d been guilty , along with Bar@@ ack Obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as inc@@ en@@ diary revelations from wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
The le@@ aks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &quot; There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the C@@ old War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
He then became the first high@@ -@@ ranking member of the U@@ .@@ S government to admit that US sp@@ ying had crossed the line , but emphas@@ ised that no one &apos;s rights had been ab@@ used .
He said : &quot; In some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . &quot;
And the President is determined to try to clari@@ fy and make clear for people and is now doing a thor@@ ough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being ab@@ used in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &quot; We &apos;@@ re dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up . &quot;
There is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is h@@ ell@@ -@@ bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments .
So what if you were able to interc@@ ept that and stop it before it happens ?
We have actually prevented air@@ planes from going down , buildings from being blown up , and people from being ass@@ ass@@ inated because we &apos;@@ ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
Meanwhile , U@@ .@@ S. law@@ makers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U@@ .@@ S. sp@@ ying and conv@@ ince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti@@ -@@ terrorism efforts with the U@@ .@@ S. , the chairman of a Sen@@ ate sub@@ committee on European affairs said on Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
Sen@@ ator Chr@@ is Mur@@ phy of Connec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti@@ -@@ terrorist organizations because of fru@@ stration over sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance by the National Security Agency .
&quot; It &apos;s really important for U@@ .@@ S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti@@ -@@ terrorism endeav@@ ors , &quot; Mur@@ phy , a fir@@ st@@ -@@ term Democ@@ rat and chairman of the Sen@@ ate Foreign Relations Sub@@ committee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
And I &apos;@@ m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in comb@@ at@@ ting terrorism , no@@ tw@@ ith@@ standing their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
News reports that the N@@ SA sw@@ ept up millions of phone records in Europe have fra@@ yed relations with some U@@ .@@ S. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of met@@ adata that Na@@ to allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other revelations c@@ ited documents le@@ aked by S@@ now@@ den that the N@@ SA mon@@ it@@ ored German Chancell@@ or Ang@@ ela Mer@@ k@@ el &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
The national intelligence director , James Cl@@ ap@@ per , def@@ ended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s common@@ place on both sides .
Am@@ id the upro@@ ar , Mur@@ phy said his office is arrang@@ ing the con@@ gres@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
Names of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
He said the it@@ iner@@ ary is still being worked out .
While Mur@@ phy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be dis@@ pen@@ sed .
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of es@@ pion@@ age programs they &apos;@@ ve used for years themselves .
&quot; While we can amend our sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;@@ re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; Mur@@ phy said .
Meanwhile , Mr Ker@@ ry is scheduled to head this week@@ end to the Middle East and Pol@@ and to address r@@ anc@@ or over U@@ .@@ S. strategies in the Syri@@ a , Egypt and Iran as well as U@@ .@@ S. sur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance activities .
New politics has begun following the changes in the boards of the Municipal Corporation .
Recently , in the San@@ thi@@ ya Municipal Corporation &apos;s Be@@ er@@ bh@@ um District , due to the party change of leg@@ islat@@ ors the Congress led board changed to the Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool board .
This change occurred because most of the leg@@ islat@@ ors , including the Chairman of the Municipal Corporation , joined Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
Not only from Congress , but some of the leg@@ islat@@ ors from CP@@ M , C@@ PI , and Forward Block have also joined Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
The Tr@@ in@@ am@@ ool Congress General Secretary Muk@@ ul Roy ad@@ mits it aug@@ urs well for the party .
He said that the San@@ thi@@ ya Municipal Corporation Chairman , Vir@@ endra P@@ ari@@ kh , and Congress leader Vi@@ pl@@ av Dut@@ ta , along with 10 Congress leg@@ islat@@ ors , have joined Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
Some leg@@ islat@@ ors from CP@@ M and Left Fr@@ ont have also joined Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
All of them informed the District Coll@@ ector in writing , as required by the Bengal Municipal Act , that they have joined Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool and because of its majority the San@@ thi@@ ya Municipal Corporation board will come under Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool Control .
Mr. Rai also claimed that everyone agre@@ es with the development template decided upon under the leadership of the Chief Minister , Mam@@ ta Baner@@ jee .
Political leaders from Congress , the CP@@ M , the C@@ PI , Forward B@@ lo@@ c and other political leaders are moving to join the Tr@@ in@@ am@@ ool Congress .
Ap@@ propri@@ ate leaders from any party are welcome to join Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
The control by Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool of the San@@ th@@ il@@ ya Municipal Board due to the change of the party by congress leg@@ islat@@ ors before the November 22@@ nd elections to be held in 5 Municipal Corpor@@ ations is considered as an important development in the political ar@@ ena .
Before this the Left Fron@@ t-@@ ruled Hal@@ dia and Congres@@ s-@@ ruled Na@@ dia Municipal boards had also come under the control of Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
When the Municipal boards in the district come under Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool party control , due to the change of party , then the new members of the party are made very welcome in Kolkata at the Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool Bhavan .
Tr@@ in@@ am@@ ool Congress General Secretary Muk@@ ul Roy is excited about the leaders breaking away from other parties to join the Tr@@ in@@ am@@ ool party .
He said that leaders breaking away from any party were welcome to join Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
He claims that the people &apos;s trust in Chief Minister Mam@@ ata Ban@@ ar@@ jee &apos;s leadership is increasing , and that this is the reason people are joining Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool .
The main opposition CP@@ M is claim@@ ing that grassroots leaders of the other parties are being threatened and bul@@ lied .
People are joining them due to the fear of Tr@@ un@@ am@@ ool &apos;s threats .
The change in the elected local boards is being considered as a blow to democracy by CP@@ M .
It is a right of any party to increase their support base in a democracy but , there are obvious questions raised by changes of opinion on the accountability of power .
Australian woman appeals Thai jail time
A 2@@ 1-@@ y@@ ear@@ -@@ old Sy@@ d@@ ney woman sent@@ enced to 15 days jail in P@@ hu@@ ket for fal@@ sely claim@@ ing she was assa@@ ul@@ ted by a tax@@ i driver is appe@@ aling the ver@@ dict and has been granted b@@ ail .
St@@ ev@@ ie Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was initially found guilty by a P@@ hu@@ ket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local tax@@ i driver , with two other men restra@@ ining her , carried out the assa@@ ult in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
However , C@@ CT@@ V foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boy@@ friend .
P@@ hu@@ ket police inter@@ viewed B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabric@@ ating the story .
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
B@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to serve the 15@@ -@@ day prison term at a low security det@@ ention centre on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of P@@ hu@@ ket rather than in an adult women &apos;s jail .
She is the daughter of former Australian le@@ ague player Pet@@ er Tun@@ ks , who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sy@@ d@@ ney &apos;s Sunday Tel@@ e@@ graph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
&quot; It &apos;s obviously been a wor@@ rying time but we &apos;@@ re hop@@ eful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; Tun@@ ks said .
B@@ am@@ ford is appe@@ aling the sentence and has been granted b@@ ail of 5@@ 0,@@ 000 b@@ ah@@ t .
Re@@ ports in Australia said that in the mean@@ time , she was holid@@ aying at the resort area of K@@ r@@ abi in Southern Tha@@ iland .
Tha@@ i@@ -@@ based legal sources said B@@ am@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ ket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and for@@ cing her to serve it in an adult prison .
However , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith in P@@ hu@@ ket , Tha@@ iland may also be looking to repair its bat@@ tered tourist image , leading to an acqu@@ it@@ tal .
Impl@@ icating B@@ ish@@ no@@ i , the MP said that eating Cur@@ ma on one day at the home of a family from a particular community and publishing photos does not make you a sup@@ porter of the poor .
They go to various houses and eat Cur@@ ma three times a day , but never bo@@ ast about it .
The MP Di@@ p@@ endra H@@ oo@@ da from Ro@@ ht@@ ak , in a meeting of the Congress ac@@ tivi@@ sts from the Ma@@ ham Hal@@ ake , said that the r@@ ally conducted on November 10th in Go@@ hana was very important for you and us .
